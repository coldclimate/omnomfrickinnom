Every so often people ask me what I use in my kitchen, and it's nothing very exciting, but I figured it was easy enough to list out.  Here's everything other than the oven, fridge and kitchen sink.

##  IKEA TILLREDA - Portable induction hob

When we moved into our house I got a got ring for the first time in my life, I was so exicted.  I hated it.  These little [Tillreda](https://www.amazon.co.uk/IKEA-TILLREDA-Portable-induction-White/dp/B06XD7HLTW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?crid=3KOJ5UQXZSTH5&keywords=ikea+induction+hob&qid=1578333789&sprefix=ikea+induction,aps,172&sr=8-3&linkCode=ll1&tag=wwwcoldclimat-21&linkId=74d9f9cdfe210bc65f891ad5823ca551&language=en_GB) portable induction rings are great and can be hung on the wall out of the way when you're not using them.  We have two, one of which is never put away.  

## Airfryer

I bought it when it was on offer and it's been a revolation.  They're not a fryer but a tiny convection oven really.  I have a slightly older model, the updated version seems to be the [Philips HD9220/50 Healthier Oil Free Airfryer](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Philips-HD9220-50-Healthier-Airfryer/dp/B006023RLQ/ref=as_li_ss_tl?crid=18MT0QUAEWPAD&keywords=phillips+air+fryer&qid=1578333917&sprefix=phillips+air,aps,169&sr=8-14&linkCode=ll1&tag=wwwcoldclimat-21&linkId=c2da0a594b4806099a5d350a29098913&language=en_GB).

## InstantPot

The InstantPot is another thing I bought when it was on offer because other people raved about them and I've fallen in love with it.  It's great to be able to to sautee, pressure cook and slow cook all in the same pan.  I have the [Instant Pot 80 Duo 8L](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Instant-Pot-80-Duo-Stainless/dp/B07W6PVT97/ref=as_li_ss_tl?crid=3JR0XI3HBG0HX&keywords=instant+pot&qid=1578334129&sprefix=instant,aps,179&sr=8-4&linkCode=ll1&tag=wwwcoldclimat-21&linkId=e8a0acdac83a8782703aab1fe401526f&language=en_GB) which I was worried was going to be too small but it fine.  It replaced my old ceramic slow cooker and negates me buying a pressure cooker (which I had been eying up)

## Breadmaker

I was given a Panasonic BreadMaker by a company I worked for years ago as part of their incentive scheme.  Over the last decade it's been an absolute trooper, turning out Saturday morning loaves every other weekend and more recently I've been making more dough in it to bake elsewhere.   The exact model is no longer available but this [Panasonic SD-2501WXC ](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Panasonic-SD-2501WXC-Automatic-Breadmaker-program/dp/B004RTJWMW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?keywords=panasonic+bread+maker&qid=1578334254&sr=8-6&linkCode=ll1&tag=wwwcoldclimat-21&linkId=c2c4cbf99d2e66f9f93660bfa8841316&language=en_GB) seems to have all the same features.  Most important is the timer, so you can set it all up before bed and wake up to the fresh bread smell.  The nuts and fruit hopper is also handy, but I've never used the jam making mode.

## Stand up mixer

I have a Kenwood Chef which I inherited from a relative.  It must date back to around the 1960s and it's still going strong (though it makes a worrying burning smell at high speed!)  The neatest equivalent is the [Kenwood KVL4100W Stand Mixer, 1200 W, 6.7 liter](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Kenwood-Chef-KVC3100W-Stand-Mixer/dp/B0725FZD9M/ref=as_li_ss_tl?crid=5NY9H6K7FJNN&keywords=kenwood+mixer&qid=1578334480&sprefix=kenwo,aps,190&sr=8-4&th=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=wwwcoldclimat-21&linkId=17b5db688168136505d5d2dec1a2adf1&language=en_GB) which has a large bowl and the three attachments (classic K beater, whisk and breadhook).   I managed to drop my original glass blender attachment (broke my heart), the moderm equivalent seems to be [this much more ugly beast](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Kenwood-KAH647PL-KAH647PL-Accessories-Food-Processors/dp/B00NW1RYHG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B00NW1RYHG&pd_rd_r=5badaaf1-ec12-4ff9-a91f-c3ddabc620b4&pd_rd_w=LI86u&pd_rd_wg=PH8BK&pf_rd_p=6f720012-7a84-4e92-a268-5ba72c1e4b52&pf_rd_r=GWJF290C1R8GBVRD2S4W&psc=1&refRID=GWJF290C1R8GBVRD2S4W&linkCode=ll1&tag=wwwcoldclimat-21&linkId=db15a5147d6edf548454b4414a6f8d4b&language=en_GB) 

## Ovenware

After inheriting a [Le CreusetEnamelled Cast Iron Round Casserole Dish with Lid](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00NQYOFHG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=wwwcoldclimat-21&linkId=7003188500109c9dd572b22469ec6ab9&language=en_GB) that must be close to 80 years old and still going strong, we decided to slowly replace our ovenware with a smaller range of higher quality items (over time, because this stuff is not cheap).  So far we've got

* [Le Creuset Toughened Non-Stick Rectangular Roaster](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Creuset-Toughened-Non-Stick-Rectangular-Roaster/dp/B00KGAJV2C/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ref_=ast_sto_dp&th=1&psc=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=wwwcoldclimat-21&linkId=b297b9b6a251bc0665dca59d821f9676&language=en_GB) which is brilliant.  The non-stick is really good, so much so that sometimes it's difficult to get those really burnt on bits that make the best gravy.
* [Le Creuset 3-Ply Stainless Steel Non-Stick 30cm Frying Pan](https://www.amazon.co.uk/CREUSET-3-Ply-Non-Stick-Frying-Stainless/dp/B018SFBPWA/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ref_=ast_sto_dp&th=1&psc=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=wwwcoldclimat-21&linkId=705ecc2d84db3ea2d24c72daa7432ee5&language=en_GB) and it's [it's lid](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Creuset-Toughened-Glass-Lid-30/dp/B0019ID8QA/ref=as_li_ss_tl?crid=3G8HXI0BGC1KV&keywords=le+creuset+lid&qid=1578335144&sprefix=le+cr,aps,173&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=wwwcoldclimat-21&linkId=d8d63fca965f9c0a06a51189047552ab&language=en_GB)  bought recently, this is a great pan and can go straight into the oven which is handy.
* [A Made-To-Last 8" Oven safe frying pan](https://www.made-to-last.co.uk/spun-iron-8-oven-safe-frying-pan.html) was a gift from my girlfriend and it's excellent quality.  

## Pariphanalia

* [Voluker Dehydrator](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07TLL91J3/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&psc=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=wwwcoldclimat-21&linkId=0a7decee7d45d20583ba16e829df1d73&language=en_GB) I'm unconvinced about the used for a dehydrator, so far I mostly dry apple slices into snacks, but I'm sure jerky and other things are on their way.  I likes this unit because it was square and packed away easily, because more seem to be round for no reason I can fathom.

* [Seriously heavy mortar and pestle](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Tera-Capacity-Pestles-Approved-Unpolished/dp/B07S2R4FPX/ref=as_li_ss_tl?crid=2MS0YQY0N0J55&keywords=mortar+and+pestle&qid=1578335477&s=kitchen&sprefix=mort,kitchen,178&sr=1-4&linkCode=ll1&tag=wwwcoldclimat-21&linkId=b95d9d0c19ec37fed07c75306d7191bc&language=en_GB)  It must weight in at 10kg, but for grinding spices and making pastes it can't be beaten.

* [Non-stick cupboard steps](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Basics-Non-Slip-Kitchen-Cupboard-Organiser/dp/B07DR4QYMK/ref=as_li_ss_tl?keywords=cupboard+spice+shelves&qid=1578335581&s=kitchen&sr=1-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=wwwcoldclimat-21&linkId=ddef6fce915836b9452789ae458548c3&language=en_GB) make finding spices so much easier because you can se everything.

* [Reusable Silicone Baking Cups](https://www.amazon.co.uk/AmazonBasics-Reusable-Silicone-Baking-Cups/dp/B01KWTGAVQ/ref=as_li_ss_tl?crid=13SDSVIM3YJN9&keywords=silicone+cake+moulds&qid=1578335641&s=kitchen&sprefix=silcone+cake,kitchen,164&sr=1-7&linkCode=ll1&tag=wwwcoldclimat-21&linkId=e60fbddbf209232d5817b4120ce49e58&language=en_GB) are surprisingly good, but work best when stood in a [Lakeland Bakeware 12 Hole Deep Bun Muffin Cupcake Baking Tin](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Lakeland-Bakeware-Muffin-Cupcake-Baking/dp/B00VAAKHWA/ref=as_li_ss_tl?crid=3LF8FEZHI2CQJ&keywords=non-stick+muffin+tin&qid=1578335692&sprefix=non-stick+mu,kitchen,152&sr=8-6&linkCode=ll1&tag=wwwcoldclimat-21&linkId=caf6b9aa30771f3fb9d69a126ac538e3&language=en_GB).  Much like Le Creuset, Lakeland kit is a bit more expensive, but generally brilliant.
