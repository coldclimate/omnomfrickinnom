I got a pack of "three chilli sausages" in an offer at the supermarket and it was a good opportunity to make something warming and wintery.

## You will need

* 6 Sausages.  I used spicy ones, if you can't find those, add a teaspoon of chilli sauce
* Half a large onion, finely slices
* 1 stick of celery, roughly sliced
* Half a carrot, peeled and fine diced
* A big sprig of thyme
* A teaspoon of stock powder
* Half a teaspoon of smoked paprika
* A tin of bollotti beans (or other small firm beans)
* A teaspoon of tomato puree
* A couple of teaspoons of oil
* A handful of flatleaf pasley, finely sliced
* A big dollop of sour cream and bread to serve

## Do

* Stick the oven on about 180 and dig out a casserole dish with a lid
* On the hob brown the sausages, onions, celery and carrot in the oil until everything is nicely coloured
* Add the stock, paprika, beans, puree, thyme, and a bean tin of hot water
* Let it all come to the boil, then pop the lid on and stick it in the oven for about an hour
* Take the lid off, chop the sausages (I snipped them in the pan using scissors) and return to the oven
* Cook for another 20 or 30 minutes until the liquid is reduced.
* Serve with a blob of sour cream, chopped parsley and probably a slice of bread to soak up the juice.

## Result

Smoky, spicy, the beans remain firm, the cream results in a rich gravy.
