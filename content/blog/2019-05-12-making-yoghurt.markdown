In a recent tweet my friend Branden mentioned [making his own yoghurt](https://twitter.com/omphe/status/1124278187536596992) to reduce the amount of single use plastic in the house and it reminded me that I'd always meant to have a go.  Rather than buying a yoghurt maker (though I might consider it in the future) I figurd I'd give it whirl lo-fi.

The idea is to hold the whole lot at around 45oC for 8 hours.  If I had a cool box I might have given that a go, but instead I tried it in a blanket.

As with all fermenting/uncooked things, cleanliness is the key.  Make sure that the pan and all utensils are super clean least you breed nasties. 

## You will need

* Full milk (I got a 3 litre bottle on offer)
* A small pot of live yoghurt (about 100ml in my case)
* A blanket
* A decent thermometer
* A funnel

## Do

* Warm the milk to 85oC
* Keep stirring and make sure it doesn't catch on the bottom
* Take it off the heat and leave to cool to 45oC (this takes a long time)
* Stir in the live yoghurt (I used a whisk to make sure it is well distributed)
* Pour it all back into the bottle (I used a funnel)
* Pop the lid on and put the bottle in a plastic bag in case it leaks
* Wrap it all up in a blanket and stach it somewhere without drafts
* (wait 8 hours)
* Mine looked and felt quite solid, so I gave it a good shake
* Mine smelt a little sour (as you might imagine) but not off at all
* I've put it in the fridge, lets see how long it stays good.


## Result

A little sour, a nice "pouring and coating" consistency.  It's creamy and rich, great on it's own or for cooking with.  Now what needs 3 litres of yoghurt?
