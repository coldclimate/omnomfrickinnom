I thought the cheese savoury sandwich was pretty universal, but after tweeting a photo of mine aroused some curiosity, I guess not.  I once lived with a chap who's [family](https://www.marktoney.co.uk/) claimed to have invented them, and for this I can only thank them.  I grew up eating them from Birkett's The Bakers in Cumbria (now bought out by Greggs) and Greggs now do a reasonable one.  Some places have tomato in there, I don't.

However, to make them at home is trivial

## You will need

* Fluffy white bread.  For some reason I think they work better with less artisan bread
* Equal quantities of...
* * Cucumber (finely diced)
* * Red pepper (finely diced)
* * Spring onion (finely diced)
* * Strong cheese (grated)
* A good grind of black pepper
* A pinch of celery salt (or just salt and add some diced celery)
* A tablespoon of mayo
* A tablespoon of salad cream


## Do

* Mix, and pile onto the bread, don't be stingy.

## Results

The blandness of the mayo is pepped up by the sharpness of the salad cream.  The over all mix is wet enough not to be cloying without being so wet as to make for a soggy sandwich.  The veg has crunch, the cheese is dominant, and if you're hungover, they are excellent.
