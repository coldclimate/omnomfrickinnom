I've always strayed away from baba ghanoush on menus because I thought it would be slimy.  Last weeks vegetable box included a pair of big purple aubergines and I didn't want them to go to waste. This week I also preserved eight bulbs of garlic by confitting them in olive oil, so I used them instead of raw galic.


## You will need

* 2 aubergine
* 2 tablespoons of tahini
* Juice of half a lemon
* A small handful of mint and parsley (finely chopped)
* A teaspoon of confit garlic and it's oil



## Do

* Half the aubergine lengthwise
* BBQ until almost burnt on both sides
* Let the cool enough to handle and scoop out the flesh (I used a grapefruit spoon)
* Pop the flesh in a sieve to drain for half an hour or so
* Chop the flesh and mix vigerously with the rest of the ingrediants



## Result

We had it as a side dish with pita breads, quickled onions and other bits and pieces.  It was good both warm (fresh) and cool the next day
