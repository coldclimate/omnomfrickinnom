After seeing deep fried halloumi on TV this week, I wondered whether it could be airfried.  Good news, it can!

## You will need

* A block of halloumi cut into chunky chips.  I got 8 out of a large slab
* A heaped teaspoon of smoked paprika
* A heaped teaspoon of onion powder
* A heaped teaspoon of ground black pepper
* 4 heaped teaspoons of plain flour
* An egg, whisked


## Do

* Stick the airfrier to 200oC
* Mix all the dry ingrediants on a plate
* Dip the halloumi in the egg and then flour mix
* If you can get away with it, double dip in egg and flour again
* Airfry for about ten minutes until the outside is crisp
* Serve with a salad, something with a bit of acid to it

## Result

Crispy, salty, chewy and satifying.  The ouside was a touch powdery because they've relied on the fat leaching out of the cheese, not been deepfried.  Next time I'm going to tumble them in a hot sweet sauce before serving.
