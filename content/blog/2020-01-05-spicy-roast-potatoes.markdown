I made this as a side dish the other night, but it was the star of the show, hence writing this up, but the lack of photos.  This started with me reading a recipe that was super complex adding fried lentils, fried sev noodles, fried onion and peanuts to the fried potatoes.  Part way though I realised... these are ingrediants in bombay mix!  So I gave it a go and everybody loved it.

## You will need

* Potatoes, scrubbed but not peeled, cut into 1.5cm cubes
* Spring onions, fine sliced, including the gree
* A red chilli finely sliced
* A big handful of [Cofresh Bombay Mix](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Cofresh-Bombay-Mix-500g-pack/dp/B00HN6Q1K2/ref=as_li_ss_tl?crid=1N3HCFGDNNSS4&keywords=cofresh+bombay+mix&qid=1578254656&sprefix=cofresh+bombay,aps,165&sr=8-3&linkCode=ll1&tag=wwwcoldclimat-21&linkId=10f63649e5312bb51e851e0c25e5246b&language=en_GB) crunched up a bit so there are no huge noodle chunks.
* A slug of olive oil
* A big spoonful of mango pickle
* A small spoonful of chilli pickle (I used [Mr Vikki's King Naga ](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Mr-Vikkis-King-Naga/dp/B005MWW3K6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?crid=UWKNG0NMHUDA&keywords=king+naga&qid=1578254830&sprefix=king+naga,aps,172&sr=8-2&linkCode=ll1&tag=wwwcoldclimat-21&linkId=e128dddcf8b68686c7d230cb4073f80a&language=en_GB))


## Do

* Stir the potatoes in a big bowl with the olive oil
* Stick them in the [airfryer](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Philips-Airfryer-Technology-Healthy-Grilling/dp/B07CT45FBT/ref=as_li_ss_tl?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=FRZ2D742AGEE5Y9CTKWR&linkCode=ll1&tag=wwwcoldclimat-21&linkId=89947d0648da38bc4a0134b2f75107c9&language=en_GB) on 200oC for about 15 minutes, until golden.  Shake the basket every 5 minutes or so to brown them evenly
* Stir the potaotes and pickles until everything is coated
* Stir in the chilli, onions and bombay mix
* Serve quickly - the noodles will go soft


## Result

Savoury as all heck.  Crunchy bits, salty bits, spicy bits, sweet, spicy, very satisfying.
