This is not a classy dish, or some high end cooking, but it's a great way to use up any vegetables going a bit soft and it's a super tasty tea.

Replace the veg with anything that's suitable to roast: tomatoes, aubergine, courgette, peppers, onions, fennel maybe even the odd apple.  

## You will need

* A big handful of oven chips
* About 3 handfuls of veg, chopped to 2cm chunks
* A couple of teaspoons of oil
* A big handful of strong cheese grated


## Do

* Stick the oven on 180
* Tumble the veg in the oil to make sure they're coated
* Stick the veg on an non-stick tray and pop them in the oven for 20 minutes or so
* Pop the oven chips in - you're aiming for the chips to finish cooking at the same time as the veg
* Once the veg are cooked and a little charred tip them into a bowl and beat them with a fork until they're a bit more saucy (burst the tomatoes etc)
* Pile veg on chips and cheese on the top


## Result

The roasting intensified the flavours, the strong cheese carries over, the chips are chips and chips are great.

For a classier finish I'd have thrown a handful of capers or fresh chopped herbs.  A blast of chilli sauce would not have gone a miss either.
