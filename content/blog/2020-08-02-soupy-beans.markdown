This week I read an article about [redbeans and rice](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2017/05/new-orleans-style-red-beans-rice-recipe.html) which looked delicious.  I didn't have any of the ingrediants, but the idea of soupy beans cooked with strong flavours and pork sounded great so I improvised.


## You will need

* 250g of strong flavored sausages (I used Italian hot from [Block'n'Bottle](https://blocknbottle.com/) ).  Sliced into fat rounds (mine were frozen solid so went in whole)
* 1 cup of dried blackbeans (aka. turtle beans)
* 1 cup of stock (I used some ham stock from the freezer)
* 1 cup of some form of tomato sauce (in this case, left over salsa)
* 1 cup of water
* A tablespoon of garlic cloves in butter
* A big handful of thyme (left on the stem)
* A red onion (finely diced)
* A heaped teaspoon of smoked paprika
* A heaped teaspoon of hot chilli
* A teaspoon of black pepper (ground)
* 2 bay leaves





## Do

* Put it all in the InstantPot for 30 minutes high pressure cooking
* Let it vent on it's own
* Slice up the sausages if you didn't already
* Give it a good stir and use saute mode to drive off liquid if needed
* Fish out the thyme stems and bay leaves



## Result

Rich, spiced, smokey, smooth creamy beans.  I'd bet it was better the next day but... I ate it all.
