I love pork scratchings.  Often too thick, too salty and too always greasy, they've got a back name, but it's easy enough to make good por scratchings.  I've no idea if these are they, but they provide the perfect toothsome snack.  I was shopping for beer at [Block and Bottle](http://www.blocknbottle.co.uk/) when I saw Steven the butcher trimming the skin off a chunk of beutifully aged pork.  He'd done a great job of leaving most of the fat on the meat (where it should be).

I couldn'y resist seeing ig the skin was available, and it was!  An experiment was on the cards.

Things to note...

* The skin was so thin in places I was concerned it would burn
* It's super tough.  I cut it into 4 eventually
* Half way through cooking it got much easier to cut the skin
* I tried both salt and peppper based streak seasoning.  Salt is the way forward

## You will need


* A piece of pig skin with as much fat attached as possible
* Salt
* Strong scissors

## Do

1. Pop the oven on about 100oC
2. Cut the skin up if you can
3. Roast for about 20 minutes
4. Slice it up
5. Add a good shake of salt and continue roasting
6. Pout off the fat as needed
7. Turn the heat up to 150 for the last ten minutes or so
8. Drain and rest on kitchen paper.
9. Store in an airtight jar, I dried mine in the oven
 

## Result

Salty, crunch, dangerously easy to break a tooth.  Best served with a shot of bourbon, a dash of pickle juice and a slice of pickle.
