No real recipe here, just another (rather serious) chunk of beef from  [G&S Organics](http://www.gandsorganics.com/) becoming dinner for a few friends. 


## You will need

### The beef
* A rib of beef.  This was a 1.5kg piece, on the bone
* A little oil
* A handful of rock salt
* Plenty of black pepper

### Herb roast potatoes

* Enough potatoes to fill a pan cut into quarters
* A couple of cloves of garlic
* A big spring of rosemary
* Olive oil
* Knob of butter



## Do

1. Get the BBQ on.
2. Rub the beef with the oil, salt and pepper.  I've started using double of tripple the amount I'd expect to
3. Put the potatoes, garlic and rosemary in the pan
4. Fill the pan with boiling water and boil for 10 minutes.
5. Drain the pan, leave it to steam for 5 minutes so the potatoes are dry but and par cooked
6. Add a glug of oil to the pan, give everything a shake and dump into a roasting pan
7. Stick the roasting tin into the over on 180 for 30 miinutes.
8. BBQ the beef for about ten minutes on both sides
9. Turn and grill the fat on the beef too!
10. Rest beef for 5 minutes whilst you dish up the potaties.
