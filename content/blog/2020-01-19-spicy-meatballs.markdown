Early this week I saw a tweet about a Smitten Kitchen post from last year for [braised ginger meatballs in coconut broth](https://smittenkitchen.com/2019/05/braised-ginger-meatballs-in-coconut-broth/) which looked excellent and I was excited to try it when I got home.   Then I got home to find I was missing most of the key ingredients.   Not to be putt off, I replaced some bits and cracked on.  It ended up far less "meatballs in sauce" that "meatballs" though.  I've never been good at reductions.


## You will need

* About 300g of beef mince
* An egg
* A couple of handfuls of breadcrumbs
* A couple of blocks of frozen spinach
* A couple of blocks of frozen ginger
* A couple of blocks of frozen garlic
* A lime (zested and juiced)
* A fresh chilli (finely sliced)
* A teaspoon of turmeric
* A tablespoon of fish sauce
* A can of coconut milk
* A couple of teaspoons of stock powder 

## Do

* Stick the oven on as high as possible
* Mix half the ginger, half the garlic, half the fishsauce, the mice, the breadcrumbs and the mince
* Shape into small balls (less than a ping pong ball)
* Stick in the oven
* In a large pan fry the rest of the garlic and ginger
* Add half the chilli, lime zest, turmeric, stock, coconut milk and an equal amount of hot water
* Let it all bubble and reduce by half
* Add the spinach, turn the heat down and pop a lid on so it doesn't reduce more
* Once the meatballs are cooked (about 15 minutes) add them to the pan, stir and let it all mellow.
* Squeeze the lime over and add the rest of the chilli before serving (I piled it onto plain white rice)

## Result

I wasn't going to write this up, so there's only one photo.  The sauce coated the meatballs beutifully, the heat comes though, the turmeric gives a great earthy depth to the flavours.
