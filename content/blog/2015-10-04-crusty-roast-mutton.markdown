Having a freezer clear out we were left with a 2kg chunk of mutton, prime for pot roasting and indeed just roasting.  Muttons got a storing flavor than lamb and needs something with some punch.  This herbs, salty crust is great.


## You will need

* Big old chunk of mutton.
* A big handful of rosemary, stripped off the branch (retain branch)
* A good squirt of [anchovy paste](http://amzn.to/1JTXllV )
* A heaped desert spoon of minced garlic
* A chunk of butter as big as the rosemary

## Do

1. Mash everything together, this takes time.
2. Slash the meat deep enough to push flavours into
3. Rub the mush into the meat, forcing it into the slashes
4. Stick the meat in a roasting tin with a lid, resting on the rosemary sticks
4. Roast under a lid at 100 just over 100 degrees for about four hours
5. Turn the heat up to 180 degrees and take the lid off for 20 minutes.
6. Rest for 15 mins (stick your plates in the oven so they're hot when you serve)




## Results

Strong flavours, rich fat, crunchy bits, soft jelly like bits, delicious.  Serve on hot plates because set mutton fat is not great.
