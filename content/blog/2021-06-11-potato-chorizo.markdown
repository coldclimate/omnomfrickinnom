Super simple, but it tasty, super savoury.  Multiple options.
Doing the potatoes under the grill makes it easier to get a good even crispy finish compared to in the pan and without using tonnes of oil.


## You will need

* A bag of new potatoes, cut into quarters
* Half a chorizo, cut into rounds on the slant, and then halved
* A big onion, cut into chunky pieces
* (optional) handful of snipped chives (and their flowers if you like)
* (optional) a handful of sauerkraut
* (optional) an egg, fried
* (optional) horseradish sauce


## Do

* Stick the chorizo and onion in a frying pan big enough to hold all the ingredients in a single layer, on a low heat.  You're aiming to get the oil to render out and the onions to soften
* Boil the potatoes for a couple of minutes (par boil) and drain well.  Leave in a collender to steam, dry and cool
* Stick the grill on full tilt so it's scortching once the chozio and onions are done
* Once the chorizo has produced plenty of oil and the onions have softened get them out of the oil, leaving as much oil as possible
* Dump the potatoes in, toss so they're covered in oil and bang it under the grill.
* Toss the potatoes every so often so everything gets crisped evenly (10 minutes or so)
* Add the choorizo and onion back to the pan and under the grill to warm though
* If you want the egg, now is the time to fry it.
* Pile out on to a plate, top with egg, kraut and horseradish and chives



## Result

Super savoury, crispy, salty, sour (kraut), spicy bite from the horseradish.  Best with a cold beer
