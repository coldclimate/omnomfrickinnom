Another warm salad this evening, this time a piece of topside done on the BBQ.  Topside would probably better slow roasted but a hot short grill and a decent rest leaves it juicy and delicious.  I tried using Matso crackers as a substitute for croutons.  This was a mistake. 

## You will need

* A chunk of lean beef.  Silverside and topside would probably work well
* A bag of peppery leafed salad
* Dijon mustard (a blob)
* Vinegar (I used a fruit vinegar that I had knocking around) 1 slug
* Olive oil 1 slug
* Capers about a heaped teaspoon per person
* Rock salt
* Pepper


## Do

1. Get the BBQ on.  I use a coal chimney and it's really excellent
2. Salt the beef well and rub it in well
3. Once the BBQ is at full tilt pop the beef on.  I kept turning it every few minutes and then moved it over out of the way of the coals and popped the lid on for 20 minutes.
4. Meanwhile, make the salad dressing.  Shake oil, vinegar,mustard, a good grind of pepper and a heavy pinch of salt until emulsified.
5. Once the beef look done, take it off the heat and wrap in clingfilm.  Rest for 20 minutes.
6. Dress salad and add capers.  Add "coutons" at this point.
7. Pile onto plates
8. Unwrap the beef and slice as thinly as possible.  I managed about half a centimetre.  Do better. 
9. Top salad with beef.

## What I'd next time

1. Matso crackers are not croutons
2. Fruit vinegar was a bit too sweet
3. Rest beef for at least 20 mins.  I gave it 10
4. Remove the connective tissue from the beef. The fast cook doens't give it time to break down

## Results

Creamy wihtout being too heavy.  Lemon offsets the grease of the chicken (no extra fat was added).  I left the bone in the chicken which might have been a mistake for ease of eating.
