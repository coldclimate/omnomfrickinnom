This week the content of our veg box lead to a super dinner.  Firstly we had a tonne of garlic (2 nets, 12+ bulbs) and we had fresh aubergines, avocado, tomatoes and a massive loaf of bread.  Firstly I made a batch of garlic confit by slow roasting 7 bulbs of garlic (thank goodness for the rubber tube garlic peeler) with a block of butter.  We'll use the jars over the next few months.

Secondly, googling aubergine and avocade lead me to [this brilliant recipe](https://www.rebelrecipes.com/griddled-aubergine-with-smashed-avocado/) which adapted nicely to what we had in the cupboard (including the tonne of garlic butter)


## You will need

* A large aubergine, sliced in half and scored deeply into squares (careful not to break the skin)
* A handful of quality tomatoes
* An avocado (halved and sliced)
* A couple of spoonfuls of garlic butter (or a clove of garlic and a tablespoon of salted butter)
* A couple of slices of quality bread
* A tablespoon of pomegranate syrup
* A tablespoon of garlic
* A pinch of chilli flakes
* A heaped teaspoon of hot smoked papkira
* A good slug of olive oil


## Do

* Stick the oven on 200oC
* Score and slice all the veg
* Rub the paprika into the aubergine and add a pinch of chilli flakes
* Drizzle about a teaspoon of olive oil onto each one, top with a teaspoon of garlc butter and a pinch of flaky salt
* Stick them and the tomatoes into a roasting tray and stick in the oven for about half an hour until the tomatoes are blackened and the aubergine is soft.
* Once everything in the oven is ready toast the bread and spread with more garlic butter
* Top the aubergine with avocade and tomatoes
* Drizzle about a teaspoon of pomegranate syrup ove the top


## Result

Sweat and sour, garlically and salty, crunchy and smooth, a dish just full of punchy flavours
