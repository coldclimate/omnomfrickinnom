## You will need

### For the dough

* 200g of plain flour
* 60g fat (I used some lard)
* About 6 tablespoons of cold water


### For the filling

In total it should add up to a couple of big handfuls

* A big handful of cookedturkey meat
* An equal amount of peas and sweatcorn
* A couple of spoonfuls of curry sauce (I used some leftover turkey curry, you just need enough to binf it all together.
* A heaped teaspoon of mustard seed
* A heaped teaspoon of cumin
* A heaped teaspoon of fennel seed
* A heaped teaspoon of coriander seed

### For frying

* Enough vegetable oil to fill a pan to a couple of inche

## Do

* Mix and kneed the dough until smooth.  I cheated and used the breadmaker
* Mix and mash the filling ingrediants.  You want to be able to fit a mix of stuff onto a teaspoon
* Divide the dough into 6 balls
* Roll the dough balls out to about 1mm or so, then divide into two semi-circles
* Pop the oil on to heat, you're aiming for 150oC
* Working one at a time, fold a semicircle in half, nipping the straight edges together, forming a cone
* Fill the cone with filling, use slightly less than you think you'll need (about a heaped teaspoon).  Avoid getting any grease on the open side or it won't close
* Close the open side over.  Dampening with a wet finger helps.  Nip it shut
* Once they're all made, slide them into the oil one at a time, don't over crowd the pan
* Ready once golden brown and the outside is bubbly and flakey

## Result

Velvety smooth, sweet and rich, with a sharp spicy finish.
