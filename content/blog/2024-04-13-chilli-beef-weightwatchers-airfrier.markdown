I freaking love British Chinese Takeaway chilli beef. Strips of beef, deep fried and coated in spicy sticky sauce.  However, it's not great for the waistline, and it's always a little underwhelming.

So, I decided to give it a go at home, and where possible make it WeightWatchers friendly.  Other than the marinating it all comes together in the same time the rice takes to cook.

## You will need

### For the beef

* 300g of lean beef.  I used bavette, sliced across the grain, into half centimeter wide strips
* 1 teaspoons of minced ginger (I used the stuff from a jar)
* 1 teaspoons of minced garlic (also from a jar)
* 1 habanero chilli finely minced
* 1 tablespoon of soy
* 1 teaspoon of neutral oil (I used a quality rapeseed)
* 2 teaspoons of corn flour

### For the rest of the dish

* 1 red pepper cut into 1 inch dice
* 2 sticks of celery, slice into pound coin thick disks
* 2 spring onions finely sliced
* 2 spring onions, sliced into batons
* 1 tablespoon of ketchup
* 1 tablespoon of soy
* 1 tablespoon of Chinese black vinegar
* 1/2 teaspoons of minced ginger
* 1/2 teaspoons of minced garlic

## Do

* Mix all the beef ingredients, other than the cornflour and marinade for as long as possible.  I was prepping at lunch time and cooked in the evening, so about 6 hours.
* When you're ready to cook, put the airfrier on high so the beef goes into a hot oven.
* Mix the beef with the cornflour, stirring so it's evenly coated.
* Spray the beef with about 2 teaspoons of oil.  I have a spray bottle for this.
* Pop the beef in the airfrier, keep an eye on it and toss as needed.
* Whilst the beef cooks, brown off the pepper, celery and spring onion batons in a teaspoon of oil
* Add the ginger and garlic to the pan and brown.
* Once the beef is crispy, set aside whilst you get the rest of the dish together
* Add the ketchup, soy and vinegar to the pan with the vegetables, stir and let it bubble for a moment
* Add the beef to the pan, toss and turn until everything is coated
* Add all the sliced spring onion
* I served it with mixed coloured rice, which doesn't make for great photos.

## Result

The beef should be properly spicy and crunchy. There should be very little loose sauce, but everything should be coated and sweet/sour.
