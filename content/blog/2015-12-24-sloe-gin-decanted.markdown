Back in October I finallly (a few weeks late) bottle up my [sloe-gin] and this evening, just in time for Christmas drinkies.  Not much to say here, decant slowly to avoid sediment, sweeten if needed (I like mine dry so I didn't) and bottle in something pretty.

I got a load of lovely glass bottles thanks to [The Herb Garden](https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Restaurant_Review-g186394-d5505226-Reviews-The_Herb_Garden-Newcastle_upon_Tyne_Tyne_and_Wear_England.html) who stashed away some of the lovely sparkling water bottles they use.  Recycling at it's best.  I used a teapot to fill the bottles because I couldn't find my funnel anywhere.

Next time I might use a gin with a higher alcohol gin (export strength) because I swear it's lost some of the booze.

## Results

The colour is tremendous, it just doesn't come though on the photos.  The flavour is light and not too sweet, perfect for sipping or mixing in a with sparkling wine.
