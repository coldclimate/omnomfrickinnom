I had a great pork chop that had been lurking in the freezer for well over a year and needed eating.  Instead of grilling it [fully loaded]({% post_url 2015-02-08-mega-pork-chop %}) or [deep fried]({% post_url 2016-01-14-deep-fried-pork-chop %}) it, I decided to bread and bake it.  


## You will need

* Pork chop
* Panko crumbs
* Chilli powder
* Paprika
* Onion powder

## Do

1. Cut pork chop off the bone.  Mine came away in a few pieces 
2. Mix spices and crumbs
3. Flatten the pork.  I used a tin of beans.
4. Coat the pork in the mix.  Push and rub it in.  I think I could have combined flattening the meat and coating at the same time
5. Bake at 180 until crisp.  Flip over part way
6. Stuff into a pita with salad and hot sauce, if so desired


## Result

Because pork is a fatty meat the fat leaks out and helps fry the outside.  They're crunhcy and tasty, through could have been a bit dry if not soaked in hot sauce.

I trimmed off the fat and baked it at the same time because I love pork scratchings.
