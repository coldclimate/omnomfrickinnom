In this week's rather excellent [Our Man Inside](http://documentally.com/newsletter/) our man [Documentally](http://documentally.com/) mentioned hit last meal would include [Iraqi Lamb and Eggplant Stew](https://www.keyingredient.com/recipes/2073565035/iraqi-lamb-and-eggplant-stew-with-pitas/?locale=en_US) which sounded like a great use for some lamb neck steaks that were in our meatbox this month.  Sadly, after looking though the kitchen cupboards I didn't have half the ingrediants, so I improvised.

I didn't have any pomegranate so I replaced it with raspberry syrup (from the Polish section of the supermarket)

## You will need

* Lamb on the bone (roughly a kilo)
* Half a red onion (fine sliced)
* A heaped desert spoon of garam masala
* A whole red chilli
* A largeful of cherry tomatoes
* A tin of chickpeas
* A handful of apricots
* 2 teaspoons of sweet fruit juice (see note above)

## Do

1. Brown the lamb in a couple of teaspoons of oil in a heavy based cassarole dish
2. Add the onion and keep it moving until it's nicely softened and taking on a little colour
3. Add the garam masala, give is a good stir round for a minute or two
4. Add a good stuck of boiling water and stir to loosen it all up
5. Add the rest of the ingrediants an bring it all to the boil
6. Turn the heat right down so it's only just moving, pop the lid on
7. Allow to cook for about an hour or so.
8. Remove the meat from bone and poke any marrow that's liberatable free
9. Remove to the lid and heat until the desired consistency
10. Serve with pita and a huge blob of hummus


## Result

Rich, sweet, enough heat to be exciting without been too bitey.  Limited photos because I wasn't planning on blogging about it.
