I very rarely fry fish, but our [FishBox](www.fishbox.co.uk) contained a couple of big fillets of [Forkbeard](https://britishseafishing.co.uk/greater-forkbeard/) so I thought I'd give it a go. I used a very thin tempura like batter.

Homemade tartar sauce is a different beast to the stuff in a jar (which I'm also partial to), and well worth the (pretty slim) effort.


## You will need

### Tartar sauce

* A desert spoonful of capers and another of their juice
* About the same amount of small gherkins (cornichons), finely chopped
* A small bunch (palm of your hand) of flat parsley
* A desert spoonful of malt vinegar
* A good pinch of sea salt 
* As much mayonnaise as you like.  I just use enough to bind it

### The fried dish

* Enough oil to fill a flat bottomed pan to a depth of about 1cm
* A couple of tablespoons of self-raising flour 
* Soda water
* A good pinch of fine salt
* A really good grind of black pepper

## Do

* Mash the tartar ingredients, without the mayonnaise, until it's as chunky as you'd like, then stir in the mayo and set aside.
* Cut the fish into pieces if you need to so that it can sit into the pan
* Put the oil in a pan on a high heat, keep an eye on it
* Whisk up flour, salt, pepper and enough soda water to make a thin batter (like paint for the wall)
* To test if the oil is hot enough, dribble a little batter in, it should sizzle quickly.  The oil should not be smoking.
* Dip pieces of fish into the batter, covering both sides, hold to drip off the excess and then add to to the pan.  I put them in skin side down first because when I did it skin side up (as every blog and book tells you to do), they curled up which was frustrating
* Cook for a couple of minutes on either side, lifting them off to a warm plate with a couple of layers of kitchen roll, holding them up to drip off the excess oil.
* Serve.  We had a big salad and a huge dollop of the tartar sauce


## Result

Forkbeard is a thick meaty fish with a lovely fresh "seaside" smell to it.  It breaks away in big flakes and the batter is crispy enough to snap, so thin it doesn't act as a sponge for the oil.

Chunky tartar is sharp, savoury and varies with every bite.
