The airfrier came into it's own this week when I discovered I could use it to make tiny cubed roast potatoes. Delicious in their own right, but excellent as part of the bulk of a meal.

I've always loves saag paneer, but it's a serious quantity of cheese in a meal.  Using an equal amount of cheese and roast potato really lightens the dish.




## You will need

* A block of paneer cut into 1.5sm chunks
* A couple of potatos, roughly twice the volume of the cheese, cut into 1.5sm chunks
* A massive bag of fresh spinach (mine was 500g)
* A small onion finely sliced
* A heaped teaspooon of grated ginger
* A heaped teaspooon of chopped garlic
* A fresh chilli sliced along it's length
* A heaped teaspoon of kashmiri chilli powder
* A heaped teaspoon of garam masala
* A tablespoon of butter
* A good pinch of salt
* A couple of teaspoons of natural oil (mine is in a spray bottle)

## Do

* Pop the airfrier on 200oC, stick the potatos in and give them a spray of oil
* Put the spinach into a big pan on a high heat, pour over a kettle of boiling water, boil of 10 seconds and then dump it out into a collendar 
* Run under the cold tap until the spinach is properly cold.  Squeeze out all the water
* Put the butter, onions, garlic and ginger in a pan on a medium heat until the onions are golden
* Add all te rest of the spices and sizzle for a minute
* Add the spinch and give it all a good stir round.  Add a little water if you need to lubricate it
* Bubble it together for a minute or two, turn off the heat.
* Once the potatoes are golden but not quite done, throw the cheese in the airfrier and give it all 5 minutes until the cheese is crisped at the edges
* When you're ready to serve, dump the potatoes and cheese, give it all a stir and a quick sizzle
* Pile onto a fresh naan


## Result

Just a little too greesy, very spicy, nicely bitter.  The chicken comes away from the bone, the onion has broken down enough to to form a velvety sauce.  The naans should have puffed up but have a slightly "layered" texture.
