Over lockdown we've been getting deliveries from [Grainge Market](https://shop.graingerdelivery.com/) which have been tremendous.  The veg boxes always come with a net of garlic bulbs and so we've got quite a stash.

Not wanting them to go to waste I've planted some, made yet more into jars of confit bulbs in butter and eaten a lot, however, there was yet more.  Twitter suggested all osrts including a 100 bulb curry, but I came across this recipe for [garlic jam by the marvelous Jack Monroe](https://cookingonabootstrap.com/2019/04/27/garlic-jam-recipe/) and it set me off down the road of a use up (as normal).  Sugar, fruit and acid are the basis for all pickles and a lot of jams, so adapt as you need to.

## You will need

* 350g of peeled garlic.  Find something good on the radio and it'll take you half an hour
* 200ml of mixed sour.  I used up the end of some [Pomegranate Molasses](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Odysea-Pomegranate-Molasses-Bottle-Pack/dp/B01H3MYGA2/ref=as_li_ss_tl?crid=1SIFNGFNIAYXQ&dchild=1&keywords=pomegranate+molasses&qid=1597513476&sprefix=pome,aps,175&sr=8-3&linkCode=ll1&tag=hhkudac-21&linkId=5efe098f146cb1207a2e2c7e6c054640&language=en_GB), white wine vinegar and a glass of red wine that got left over and had gone a bit sour
* 200g of sugar or there abouts
* A big handful of fresh thyme
* a couple of teaspoons of oil


## Do

* Peel the garlic.  I couldn't be bothered to then slice it
* Pop it in a pan on a low heat with the oil for 10 minutes or so until it colours a little and softens
* Add the thyyme.  I just chopped the stems into 1 inch lengths and added the lot
* Add the liquid and half the sugar, turn the heat up to bring it to the boil, then lid on and heat down for 10 minutes or so.
* Mash it all up with a potato masher, add the rest of the sugar and then give it a blast on high heat for a few minutes
* Leave it to cool in the pan and jar up


## Result

Deeply savoury, very garlicky (unsurprisingly), sweet enough to go on toast but I suspect it will make an amazing base spooned into stews and curries.
