Sometimes things come together perfectly, almost as if they were planned or predestined.  Today was such a day.  I was extolling the virtues of my new favourite drink at work and one of my colleagues mentioned something his partner said and the drink was named.  I present The Winky, named by Lyndsey Tait.  Why? For she perfect observation that "the lemon 16%* is the winkyiest**"


## You will need

* 100ml (1/3 of a can of "16%*" [San Pellegrino Limonata](http://amzn.to/1QPTF3z)
* 50ml of [Aperol](http://amzn.to/1IG1bLI)
* 50m of gin (something oily and strong like [Plymouth](http://amzn.to/1QPUs4I)
* A handful of ice would be good
* A heavy based rounded glass


## Do

1. Mix


## Result

Bitter and herbal yet sweet and moreish.  Significantly winky.

\* In our office [San Pellegrino Limonata](http://amzn.to/1QPTF3z) is known as 16%, mostly because it contains 18% juice.  We're a funny little tribe.

\*\* "Winyiest" eg. makes one wink the most due to the full force of the 16%*
