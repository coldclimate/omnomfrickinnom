Sometimes things come together perfectly, almost as if they were planned or predestined.  Today was such a day.  I was extolling the virtues of my new favourite drink at work and one of my colleagues mentioned something his partner said and the drink was named.  I present The Winky, named by Lyndsey Tait.  Why? For she perfect observation that "the lemon 16%* is the winkyiest**"


## You will need

* 100ml (1/3 of a can of "16%*" [San Pellegrino Limonata](https://www.amazon.co.uk/San-Pellegrino-Sparkling-Limonata-6-Count/dp/B00EF8TXFQ/ref=as_li_ss_tl?keywords=San+Pellegrino+Limonata&qid=1578336436&sr=8-10&linkCode=ll1&tag=wwwcoldclimat-21&linkId=cd67140caab42f9e86df99b1b9ee3e38&language=en_GB)

\* In our office [San Pellegrino Limonata](http://amzn.to/1QPTF3z) is known as 16%, mostly because it contains 18% juice.  We're a funny little tribe.

\*\* "Winyiest" eg. makes one wink the most due to the full force of the 16%*
