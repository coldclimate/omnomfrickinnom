I've not had a lot of time for fun cooking recently, but I've bene really enjoying simply cooked meat on the BBQ with fresh salad.  Today though I had the time and headspace to have a play.  I realised that I could buy meat at lunchtime, marinade it in the fridge at work and then BBQ it when I get home, after it's 6 hour marinade.  Nothing smart, now I write it down, but I was chuffed with myself.

Thus, today I set off to work with a bag of marinade (surprisingly stinky), and popped to the brilliant [Block&Bottle](https://blocknbottle.com/) and bought chicken wings (3 bone) and a fat slice of pork belly (on the bone).  Joel weighed them and then I dropped them straight into my bag of marinade.  B&B don't use plastic bags, but if they did, this would have saved a few.

Once I was back in the office I popped the whole lot into the fridge and picked it up at the end of the day.  2 hours of low BBQ later and it was *amazing*.

This year I've been using my gas BBQ a lot more than my [ProQ](https://amzn.to/2JcrmAP) after a lot of problems keeping the coals topped up.  Slow, slow and smoky on gas is surprisingly easy, if a little inauthentic.

## You will need

* A couple of tablespoons of hot suace - I used [Encona Original](https://amzn.to/2LCr1sK)
* A heaped teaspoon or two of minced garlic
* A heaped teaspoon or two of minced ginger
* A heaped teaspoon or two of runny honey
* Chicken wings (3 bone are my favorite because they have the wing tip)
* A chunk of pork belly on the bone (like a mega rib)
* A big handful of smoking chips (I used [apple wood](https://amzn.to/2RQF4Ms) )


## Do

* Mix all the marinade ingrediants
* Stick the meat in the same bag and fridge it for as long as you can (6 hours was fine)
* Put the meat on one side of the BBQ, light the gas on low on the other
* Pop a handful of wood chips into a smoke box on above the heat
* Pop a drip tray under the meat (tinfoil for me.  This stops the drips burnt on the hot plate underneith)
* Watch of 2 hours.  Adjust the heat so it's stilling at about 150 oC. Move meat around so that nothing is burning. 
* Turn up the heat at the end for 2 minutes to crisp up the edges if needed.

## Result

Sweet on the lips.  Burning heat when bitten.  2 hours is long enough to start rendering the fat in the pork belly.  The smoke is gentle but deep.  I should have scored the pork fat every 5mm to make it easier to cut, it went very hard (but delicious)
