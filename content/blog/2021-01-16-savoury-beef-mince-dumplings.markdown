Growing up I hated mince and plain boiled potatoes, which is a shame because other than me it was something of a family favorite.  Having grown up, I still don't enjoy boiled potatoes, but I discovered dumplings, and that changed everything.

This recipe uses far less fat in the dumplings than many but the self-raising flour and soda water makes them light and fluffy.

This cooks in one pan with a lid.  I have a [Le Creuset frying pan](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Creuset-3-Ply-Stainless-Non-Stick-Frying/dp/B002VXU8O2/ref=as_li_ss_tl?dchild=1&keywords=Le+Creuset+frying&qid=1610826845&sr=8-7&linkCode=ll1&tag=hhkudac-21&linkId=a45923976367670420a6f46fb506a116&language=en_GB), which was painfully expensive but really is great and should last forever. 

## You will need

* Beef mince
* The same volume of finely diced onion, carrot and celery as you have mince.  I used pre-chopped stuff from the supermarket
* A small onion cut into 8
* Half a can of beer (I used Stones bitter)Le Creuset
* A stock cube
* A teaspoon of dried oregano
* 150g of self-raising flour
* About 50g of beef suet or finely diced butter
* A big pinch of salt
* Soda water
* A couple of teaspoons of vegetable oil


## Do

* Pop the mince and oil in the pan on a reasonable heat and brown the mince
* Lift the mince out (to stop it burning), leaving the fat in the pan
* Add the vegetables and cook them out for a good 5 minutes until the onions are starting to colour
* Add the mince, the stock cube, oregano, beer and about another 200ml of hot water
* Give it all a good stir round, pop the lid on and reduce the heat so it's a gentle bubble
* After about 20 minutes, make up the dumplings
* If you're using butter, rub it into the flour
* Add the salt and enough soda water to bring it together into a rough shaggy dough
* Split the dough into as many dumplings as you'd like. The bigger they are the longer they take to cook
* Nestle the dumplings in the pan.  There should be more liquid than you'd like the final dish to have, the dumplings will soak it up.
* Cook under a lid for around 20 minutes - watch the liquid doesn't boil away completely, though a few stuck on bits are good.

## Result

The dumplings should puff up, their bases soaking up the juices, the beer and stock should have reduced to a delicious savory coating.  

You might spy some sprouts in there.  I tucked a few frozen ones in when I added the dumplings and they streamed at the same time.
