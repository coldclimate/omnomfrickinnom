As I started writing this up I realised I'd already written up [sweet and sour pork]({% post_url 2015-11-01-sweet-sour-pork %}) which is pretty much identical.  This one however is much lower in fat and thus far less WeightWatchers points (which I'm counting at the moment.)

## You will need


* A bag of frozen prawns
* A small tin of pineapple chunks
* A green pepper (sliced)
* A small red onion (fine sliced)
* A chilli (chopped)
* A heaped tablespoon of crystalised ginger (chopped)
* A teaspoon of lazy garlic
* A teaspoon of cornflower
* A tablespoon of wine vinegar
* A tablespoon of ketchup
* A teaspoon of oil
* Chilli flakes in oil (to taste)



## Do

1. Stick the rice on to cook, everything else comes together quickly.
2. Slice and dice everything in preparation
3. Strain the pineapple juice and mix with cornflower and ketchup until smooth
4. Cook onion in a teaspoon of oil until soft
5. Add peppers, chilli, ginger and garlic, cook on for a few minutes on a medium heat
6. Add pineapple and turn the heat up to high
7. Add the vie looking liquid mix, bubble and stir until ready
8. Add chilli flakes if needed.

## Result

Sweety, slightly gooey and sticky, spicy and better than the takeaway.  Mine with 9 SmartPoints including the rice too so I've enough points for 10 gins.  Perfect
