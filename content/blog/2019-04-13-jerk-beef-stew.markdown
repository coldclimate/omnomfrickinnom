For April is still unfeasibly cold and grey, so I fancied some sunny flavours.  Nothing tastes more like the sun that jerk with is sweat chilli, bright thyme and fragrent spices.  Sadly I didn't have any pork or chicken in so I tried the same sorts of flavours with stewing beef.  Success, though surprisingly hot.

## You will need

* Dices braising steak roughly diced
* 2 habinaro peppers finely sliced
* A teaspoon of whole allspice
* Half a teaspoon of cloves
* A couple of heaped teaspoons each of grated ginger and garlic
* A handful of fresh thyme finely chopped and pulled off the twig
* An aubergine roughly chopped


## Do

* Brown the beef in a large pan with a few teaspoons of oil until well coloured
* Gring the spices 
* Dump the ginger and garlic into the pan and stir until browned
* Dump the spices and thyme and stir
* Add a mug of boiled water
* Stir round and scrape all the bit off
* Stick everything in the slow cooker, including the aubergine
* Slow cook for about 4 hours or so
* Serve with coconut rice and finely sliced spring onion

## Result

Surprisingly dry, very fragrent, surpisingly hot.  You need the sweet and sticky rice.
