This year I've had more success than last year growing chillis, so it was high time I made a chilli with them.  I also managed to grow a tonne of herbs, so I thought I'd make use of them too.

The traditional accompaniment to chilli (not that this is a real chilli, my Texan friends would turn their noses up at it) is cornbread.  These cornbread muffins are fully of roasted corn and hefty. 

## You will need

### For the chilli

* Diced beef steak, aboutt 300g, shaken in plain flour
* An equal volume of mushrooms, quartered
* A heaped teaspoon of blackpepper corns roughly ground
* A heaped teaspoon of cumin seeds roughly ground
* A heaped teaspoon of tomato paste
* A heaped teaspoon of english mustard (I was having a use up)
* About 200ml of beer
* A big handful of mixed herbs - I had marjoram and thyme
* A clove of garlic
* Chillis (I used 3 long cayenne)

### Cornbread muffins

* 140g of self-raising flour and polenta mixed (roughly half and half) 
* 200ml of buttermilk
* An egg
* A good pinch of salt
* A sweeatcorn
* A tablespoon of butter, melted
* A handful of grated strong cheddar
* A tablespoon of maple syrup or honey

## Do

### The chilli 
* Brown the beef in oil in a heavy based casserole dish on a hgh heat
* Add the cumin, blackpepper and galic clove
* Sizzle a bit, add the mushrooms and turn the heat down
* Keep everything moving until the mushroom have cooked though and tarted to release their liquid
* Add the rest of the ingrediants, give it a good stir, turn the heat down and pop a lid on
* Simmer on a low heat for an hour or two making sure it doesn't go dry.
* Best left to go cold and reheated as the muffins are in the oven


### The muffins

* Pop the oven on 200oC 
* Pop the grill on high
* Stick the corn under grill, keep turning until it nicely blackened on all sides
* Pour a little butter into each hole in the muffin tin (I have a 6 hole muffin tray)
* Whisk all the other ingrediants (it's surprisingly liquid)
* Slice the corn off the cob and and stir through the batter
* Split the batter between the muffin holes and bake for about 20 minutes or until slightly risen and golden on the top


## Result

I'm shattered, pictures over words.
