Perfect is a big claim, but these are pretty damned good.  I've pinched a bunch of ideas from other people over time I've no idea who but probably my gran, Nigel Slater and Nigella.  If you can use the fat off a roast instead of the sunflower all the better.  Same tin - even more better.

Turns out I included most of this in [beef-rib-pickled-onion-gravy] but I've just done another roast and the photos were too good to not post.

## You will need

* Potatoes suitable for roasting (waxy or general purpose, not baby ones)
* A tin big enough to hold the potatoes in a single layer when quartered
* Enough sunflower oil to coat the bottom of the tin to about 3mm
* A heaped tablespoon full of corn flower or plain flour


## Do

0. Stick the oven on at maximum
1. Quarter the potatoes. I don't bother peeling them
2. In a big pan cover the potatoes with cold water to just over. Lid the pan
3. Turn the heat on full tilt
4. Pop the tin of oil in the oven - you want it super hot by the time the potatoes are ready
5. Once the potatoes are boiling turn th heat down so it's simmering and boil for 5 minutes.
6. Strain them an return to hot pan without a lid.  Let them steam until they look dry
7. Add the flour, lid and shake around.  Hopefully the potatoes are intact, completely coated in flour and a bit beaten up with rough edges.
8. Super carefully, pour the hot oil into the pan, lid, shake and then pour into the tin..
9. Return to the oven, turn the heat down to 180.
10. Use a metal fish slice to flip them over after about half an hour.
11. Pour the fat out after about another 15 mins.
12. Return to the over for another 15 mins.



## Results

Crunchy on the outside, fluffy on the inside, crunchy burnt edges.
