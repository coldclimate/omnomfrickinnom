I got given a bacon making kits for Christmas.  A quick word with [G&S Organics](http://www.gandsorganics.com/) secured me a substantial piece of belly pork (about 5lbs).  This is mostly pictures because the process was very simple.

Bonus: you get  to make pork scratchings too!


## You will need

* A great chunk of belly pork
* [A bacon making kits](http://amzn.to/1GSI7bF)
* [A cold smoke generator](http://amzn.to/1eQqtfz) (if you want smoked bacon)


## Do

1. Cut the pork into a size you can fit in a tight fitting plastic bag
2. Rub the cure and marinade into both sides of the pork
3. Bag it
4. Fridge it for a week, turning each day*
5. Cold smoke for a few hours
6. Bake in the oven at 80oC for 2 hours
7. Let is cool and then fridge for a couple of hours
8. I halved the piece to make it easier to work with
8. Slice, bag and freeze
9. Treat yourself to a sandwich with the offcuts

At this point I should point out my mistake: leaving the skin on.  Real pig skin is tough as leather, especially after a couple of hours smoking and baking.  The first piece was so hard to slice I blistered my hand.  If you slice off the skin you get to crisp it in the oven afterwards too to make pork scratchings.
