Another use up tea, super quick, idea to plate in less than ten minutes.


## You will need

* A pack of gnocchi
* A large leek, finely sliced
* A good grating of Parmesan
* A couple of tablespoons of sour cream
* A couple of teaspoons of vegetable oil


## Do

* Cook the leeks in a teaspoon of oil on a pretty high heat until mostly translucent and a few crispy bits then set aside
* Boil the gnocchi in boiling salted water for 2 minutes then drain and set aside
* Put a a couple of teaspoons of vegetable oil into a non-stick pan on a high heat
* Add the gnocchi, cook for a few minutes, tossing occupationally.  You want some of the pieces to have crunchy bottoms.
* Add the leeks, cream, parmesan and a good grating of black pepper to the pan and stir round until everything is well coated
* Serve


## Results

Crispy bits, chewy bits, creamy and not too rich, the leek flavour carries though.  Perfect on a cold winter evening.
