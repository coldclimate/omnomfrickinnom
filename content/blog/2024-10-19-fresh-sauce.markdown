I recently read somewhere about making a chutney that's not aged and is a "fresh" condiment with spicy food.  Having got a load of herbs knocking about, I whizzed some up and it was great.  It doesn't last, but it's hot and sharp, and adding different fruits is fun.

## You will need


* 1 small bunch of coriander
* A lemon, or lime, or citrus zest and juice
* Some chillis.  I used a couple of frozen green finger chillis
* Some fruit.  I used an over ripe peach, skinned.

## Do

* Zest and juice the citrus into a whizzer
* Whizzer all the rest together
* Adjust with oil and water or more juice to get the right consistency
* Add a good pinch of salt

## Result

Hot and sour, fresh and fragrant, the peach added a nice sweetness to it.  It doesn't keep long even covered in the fridge to a slung it on chicken wings, a big salad and even creme crackers.
