I love making bacon.  It's not hard, but it takes time, and probably costs way more than buying the best bacon, but I love it all the same.  After getting a chunk of belly pork in my meatbox I was browsing through [Curing & Smoking: River Cottage Handbook No.13](http://amzn.to/2sVtYZU) looking at bacon recipes and found the basic one looked great except I had no juniper berries.  The temptation to replace it with gin was too great.

It ends up being a wet cure, and might have benefitted from a few days air drying, but the results were excellent, the sweetnes of the gin really coming through nicely.  Also, I had the wrong smoking chips, so I ended up with only a very light smoking, but it might have been all the better for it.

## You will need


* A slab of belly pork, mine was about a kilo
* 4 teaspons of salt
* 6 teaspoons of brown sugar
* 1 teaspoon of black pepper
* 1/8 teaspoon of salt peter
* A bay leave
* 50ml of gin (I used [Portobello Road](http://amzn.to/2sV5lMC))

## Do

1. Wash and dry the meat
2. Mix all the brining ingrediants except the gin
3. Rub the belly down with about half the curing mixture
4. Pop it in a tight sealabe plastic bag, wrapped tightly and place skin side down in the fridge for a day
5. (wait 24 hours)
6. Pour off any liquid which has leached out
7. Mix the gin and the remaining rub, then rub into the meat
8. (wait a week)
9. Rince off under the tap and pat dry.
10. Smoke for a couple of hours



## Result

I should have cured for longer, the ends were excellent but the middle part probably needed a little longer.
