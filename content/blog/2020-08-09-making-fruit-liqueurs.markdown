It's been an amazing summer for fruit and during lockdown I've been walking a lot round a local industrial estate, listening to podcasts and occationally picking fruit.  I've had an amazing haul of cherries (bitter and sweet), brambles (blackberries) and looking at branches the apples are going to be amazing.

Anyway, I've three different things currently maserating, I'll update this post once they are ready for bottling and drinking.

## Creme de mure

An equal weight of brambles and red wine.  I'll be adding sugar and strong alcohol (probably gin, made, neutral grain spirit) after a month.

## Cherry liqueur

A bottle of 63% white rum and as many cherries as I could fit in.  The highproof booze is because I want this to end up at around 40% even with the fruit juice

## Bourbon, cherries and lavender

I saw Anna from [CookHouse](https://www.cookhouse.org/) [posting about this over on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/CDPB0vmJYUQ/) and couldn't resist giving it a try.  I found a bottle of bizzare bourbon/scotch mix to try this with.
