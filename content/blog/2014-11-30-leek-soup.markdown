Winter is here and a lazy Saturday afternoon demanded soup.  Ready in 30 minutes, creamy and luxurious, the potato reduces the slimyness that you sometimes get with leeks and the butter ups the creamy feel.

## You will need

* 1 large leek, as long as your forearm
* A couple of small potatoes
* A chunk of butter
* half a vegetable stock cube
* a glug of milk



## Do

1. Fine slice the leek.  2mm slices, including the green top.
2. grate to potato
3. Melt half the butter in a pan and add the potato.
4. Over a medium heat cook to potato for a few minutes
5. Add the leeks and the rest of the butter, turn the heat down and pop a lid on
6. Cook the leeks off until tender, probably about ten minutes. The aim here is softened and only slightly coloured.  Stir occasionally to make sure nothing sticks.
7. Add the stock cube and about a pint of boiling water.  Turn up the heat to a rolling boil.
8. After a few minutes turn off the heat and leave to cool for a little
9. Blend until smooth.  Add a little butter and milk to adjust the texture as needed
10. I served with a sprinkle of Parmesan and black pepper.
