Boston baked beans, cooked with treacle and pork, are a world away from tinned baked beans, good as they are.  Sadly, they're also not very gout friendly due to the amount of pork, so I had a stab at making something as close as I could get.  They're not quite savour enough, but not far off.


## You will need

* Enough dried borlotti beans to cover your instantpot pan to a depth of about an inch
* 1 large onion halved
* 2 large onions finely sliced
* 2 bay leaves
* 2 cloves of garlic, crushed
* A teaspoon of ground black pepper
* A teaspoon of mustard powder
* 2 teaspoons of stock powder
* A big spring of fresh oregano or a heaps teaspoon of dried
* A tablespoon of oil
* 300ml of cider or 150ml of cider and cider vinegar
* A tablespoon of treacle or molasses
* About 100ml of sweet and smokey BBQ sauce - I used the end of a bottle of [Sauce shop cherry bourbon](https://www.sauceshop.co/products/cherry-bourbon-bbq-sauce-1)
* 

## Do

* Put the beans and a bayleaf into the instant pot, 6 inches of water to the top and pressure cook for 30 minutes on high, then leave to cook.
* Drain the beans, retain the liquid in case you need to adjust the texture of the beans later
* Clean the Instant Pot and then saute on high the oil, onions, garlic and bay leaf until well coloured (15 mins or so)
* Add the rest of the ingredients, except the beans and cook for around ten minutes
* Add bake the beans, stir well, turn off the instantpot and close the lid.  Let it all come together.

## Results

It's not quite as salty and meaty-satisfying as Boston Baked Beans, but they've been a great accompaniment to several meals.
