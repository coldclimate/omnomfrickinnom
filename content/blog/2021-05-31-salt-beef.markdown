I've made pastrami before, but not it's precursor, salt beef.  I couldn't find my pink curing salt, it came out a little grey in colour, but delicious.


## You will need

* A piece of brisket or silverside beef, around a couple of kilos
* Enough cold water to cover it, I needed 2kg
* 80g of salt
* 40g of dark sugar
* A tablespoon of black pepper corns, roughly crushed
* A tablespoon of coriander seeds,  roughly crushed
* A couple of bay leaves
* A teaspoon of chilli flakes
* A couple of carrots, in big chunks
* An onion, halved
* A few sticks of celery, roughly chopped

## Do

### The brining

* Trim all the fat and as much connective tissue you can get to.
* Dissolve the salt and sugar in the least possible hot water then top up with cold water
* Stir in half the black peppercorns
* Stir in all the other ingredients 
* Submerge the beef in the brine, making sure it's completely covered, weigh it down if needed
* Cover it and pop it in the fridge for 5 to 7 days


### The cooking

* Rinse off the beef and cut it in the InstantPot with enough water to cover it
* Add the remaining blackpepper, carrots, onion, celery and a few extra bay leaves if you have them
* Pop the lid on, close the valve, and pop it steam mode for 2 hours
* Once you're ready to eat, ideally leave the InstantPop to cool enough to open the lid, lift out carefully and cut thick slices.


## Result

Traditionally salt beef would be served with boiled potatoes, but I hate them, so we made massive sandwiches instead.  The other fillings included sauerkraut, coleslaw made with green cabbage and apple an quickled cucumber.
