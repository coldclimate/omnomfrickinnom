For a couple of Fridays in a row we had the same super tasty, super quick tea.  The fish cooks in a tinfoil packet on the same tray as the oven chips so there's less washing up.  The butter and juices make a delicious sauce.  



## You will need

* A portion of oven chips
* A pieces of fish.  I've used seabass, sea bream and trout, all worked well.
* A tablespoon of capers
* A good bunch of parsley (finely chopped)
* A piece of butter, about as much as you'd use on two luxurious pieces of toast
* A slice of lemon if you have it

## Do

* Stick the oven on 180oC
* Cut a big enough piece of tin foil to hold the fish one folded over
* Stick the oven chips in the oven on a tray big enough to hold them and the fish
* Pop the fish, capers (and a teaspoon of the brine from the jar), butter, parsley and lemon if you're using it on the foil, skin side up if you don't want it to stick
* Fold it into a parcel, double folding the edges to they're air tight
* After the chips have been in ten minutes, add the fish
* Once the chips are ready (about another 10 minutes) pull it all out of the oven
* The tinfoil package should have puffy up with stream, open it carefully




## Results

Crunchy cheese, rich and slightly sharp beans, cripsy and fluffy toast.  A good dose of black pepper didn't go amiss.
