I don' like liver, until I crave it, so when I read an excellent looking recipe for [a Lebanese liver dish](http://www.louchegastronomique.com/2016/chicken-livers-with-pomegranate-molasses-sawda-djej/) a few days ago I was suddenly craving it hard.  Irritatingly I couldn't find the recipe as I was walking home to look up the ingredients, and I misremembered it as being Moroccan, so set about making it up as I went along.

## You will need


* Chicken livers, I used a 250g pack
* A small red onion
* A pomegranate
* A heaped teaspoon of ras el hanout
* A good slug of pomegranate juice - I used  [POM Wonderful Pomegranate Juice](https://www.amazon.co.uk/POM-Wonderful-Pomegranate-Juice-710ml/dp/B015QA22YA/ref=as_li_ss_tl?keywords=POM+Wonderful+Pomegranate+Juice&qid=1578226564&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=wwwcoldclimat-21&linkId=240d1acf545db6273fc4807d7ed646fb&language=en_GB)
* A large bunch of parsley, stems chopped and tops roughly chopped
* A flatbread.
* I put a sprinkle of my [salad topping seeds]({{<ref "2016-03-06-salad-seeds.markdown">}})



## Do

0. Soak the liver in plenty of water whilst you prepare everything else
1. Fine slice the onion and pop in a pan with a drop of oil to fry slowly
2. Seed the pomegranate and trim the liver of connective tissue whilst the onion fries
3. Add the ras el hanout to the onion and turn up the heat.  Sizzle for a minute
4. Add the liver and parsley stems, sizzle and stir
5. Once the liver looks set, add the rest of the ingredients except the seeds
6. Give it all a good bubble and let the liquid redue to next to nothing.  Warm the bread in the meantime
7. Pile it all together.  I served it with a blob of yoghurt and some olives, with the seeds piled on top

Tip: if your flatbread has gone a bit stale run it under the tap, not just dampen it, but actually run it under, then pop under a hot grill.  Revitalises it magically.

## Result

Sweet, sticky, savoury, morish.  Ticked off my need for liver for another few months.
