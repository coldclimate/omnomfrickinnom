After getting a chance to buy some goat on the bone from [The Lakewood Goat Company](http://thegoatcompany.com/) whilst they were at [Jesmond Food Market](https://twitter.com/JesFoodMkt) there was only one thing on the cards, curry goat.  I can't claim and Jamaican roots, but I've got a soft spot for the spicy, rich, soured curry.

It turned out getting fresh scotch bonnet chillis in February in North East England was pretty difficult, so I ended up adding a couple of measures of a fruity scotch bonnet based chilli sauce from Tescos and it worked rather well.  Good heat and the papaya added a nice sweetness.

This has lots of ingrediants, but it's very simple, it just takes some time.

## You will need

* About a kilo of goat meat, diced, ideally with the bone
* A single large onion (or 2 medium ones)
* A couple of scotch bonnets
* A few goodd springs of thyme
* A few curry leaves
* 100g of ginger (a piece about the size of your palm)
* 100g of garlic (a healthy bulb)
* Half a stock cube (I used chicken)
* A tin of beans (I used kidney, black eye or pinto would also work)
* A couple of tablespoons of mild curry poweder (I used an indian mix)
* A cup of tomatos
* The zest of a quarter of a lemon
* Juice of half a lemon

## Do

If you do all your stove top stuff in an oven proof dish with a lid you make your life easier

1. Pop the oven on about 150
2. Brown the goat in batches with a little oil.  You want some good colour in there
3. Fine dice the onion
4. Grate the ginger (peel it first using a teaspoon)
5. Once the meat is browned lift it out and addd a little more oil
6. Add the onions, ginger and minced garlic
7. Keep stirring until everything has taken some colour and softened a little
8. Make up half the stock cube with about 300ml of hot water
9. Add the stock, tomatoes, thyme, curry leaf, lemon peel, lemon juice and chilli sauce
10. Turn up the heat until everthing is boiling
11. Add the goat and the beans (drained)
12. Give it all a good stir and pop it in the oven with a lid on
13. In about an hour give it a stir, check it's not going dry.  Add a little more water if needed
14. After about half an hour or so turn off the oven, remove the lid, return the pan to the oven and close the oven
15. It will cook though and reduce in it's own heat

Lift the bones out, stiring in any marrow that you can liberate. Serve with coconut rice or breads.  I added a dollop of the hot sauce and a bit of fresh snipped coriandor.


## Result

Rich, sour, hot, soul warming.
