I love thin cut steak, but it's virtually impossible to cook well. On a thick cut steak I love crispy blacken outside and a super rare middle.  Adding a little drama to the table is no bad thing.

If I was doing this again I'd cut the steak into  two inch squares, which I did with a couple of the offcuts and they were better than the main course!  The edges crisped and I could cook each piece with 10 seconds either side to perfection.

## You will need

* A pack of thin cut beef steak.  I'd guess that it was thin sliced silverside or topside
* A pack of premixed grill marinade  I used [Schwartz Grill Mates Mojito Lime](http://amzn.to/2avi98b) and it was excellent.
* A blowtorch. YEAH, A BLOWTORCH!

## Do

1. Rub marinade into the steak and cut into 2 inch pieces
2. Support a metal tay on something heat proof
3. At the table blast a piece at a time, putting the brightest one of flame on the edges and work your way round.  Flip over and repeat. Move round the metal board if it gets too hot.

## Result

The sugar in the marinade carmelises, the fat edges crisp and yet the middle of the beef is still rare and tender.
