I love fresh pineapple.  Recently we've been eating it in salsa a lot (grill until blistered, mash with chilli and corriandar), and it made me thing of something I heard years ago but can't source, that ripe pineapple is great with salt and chilli powder.  I've no idea where I heard it and can't find anything online, so I figured I'd just try it.  Next time (and there will be a next time), I'm going to try fresh slices habinaro chillis.

## You will need

* A fresh pineapple (mine was a touch over ripe)
* Hot chilli powder
* Sweet cinnamon
* Sea salt


## Do

* Slice the pineapple right across into rings about an inch think 
* Sprinkle each one with a good pinch each of sea salt, chilli and cinnamon
* Stack them all up again and leave on a plate in the sun for an hour
* Slice each piece into 8 for each eating


## Result

Super sweat, with an extra bite, the salt seems to make it even more juicy and the acid/chilli combination leave a burn on the lips.

Seen here with a large ginger beer and a small cat, on the first sunny afternoon of the year.
