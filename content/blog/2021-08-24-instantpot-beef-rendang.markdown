I can't bring myself to call this beef rendang, because that would be a travesty.  It is however super tasty and features some of the same flavours and it quick.

As it cooks it does not look appetising, especially as the fat renders, press on, keep stirring.


## You will need

* 300g of diced beef (stewing steak / braising steak)
* About 2 tablespoons of minced garlic
* About 2 tablespoons of minced ginger (I used the frozen blocks)
* A habanero chilli
* A tablespoon of fish sauce
* A tablespoon of lime juice
* A chunk of coconut cream block about the size of 3 stock cubes (I am sorry, I've no idea what weight)
* 3 or spring onions, slices and green separated from white
* A tablespoon of oil

## Do

* Brown the beef in the oil on saute mode for about 10 minutes
* Add the rest of the ingredients except the green spring onion
* Pressure cook for 20 minutes and let it cool so you don't loose the liquid
* Once it's cool,open the lid, give it all a vigorous stir and then saute again until it reaches a coating consistency
* Pile on top of rice, with the sliced green onion on the top


## Results

Rich, savoury, meat should hold it's shape.  It's not as dark as a real thing, but then it's 30 minutes, not 4 hours.
