A very quick, easy and vegetarian tea, perfect for using a huge bag of spinach that was very heavily discounted.  Adapted from [the perfect               saag paneer](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2014/jun/26/how-make-perfect-saag-paneer-vegetarian-indian).  I added the soft cheese because it was a little dry, a splash of single cream would have been good too.

Once this starts to come together it's pretty quickly o have your rice/plates/etc ready to go.


## You will need

* About 500g of fresh spinach
* A pack of paneer - mine was 250g, cut into 1cm cubes
* A small onion - finely slices
* 4 fat cloves of garlic - finely slided
* A couple of inches of fresh ginger finely sliced or grated
* A slice of the block of butter, about an inch thick, I'd guesstimate this is 75g or so
* A heaped teaspoon of you favorite spice mix, I used [Panch Puran](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Seasoned-Pioneers-Phoran-Indian-Spices/dp/B00BXC6PMQ?dchild=1&keywords=Panch+Puran&qid=1617131485&sr=8-15&linkCode=ll1&tag=hhkudac-21&linkId=83cdc06bd27d938910caabe02ee01f23&language=en_GB&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) - ground
* A couple of fresh green chillis, finely sliced
* A tablespoon of soft cheese.


## Do

* Melt the butter and then fry the pareer until golden on as many sides as you can be bothered to turn it though
* Lift the paneer off to a plate, keeping as much butter in the pan as you can in the pan
* Boil the kettle, pop the spinach in a big pan, pour over the boiling water and stir it round for a minute
* Pour it all though a sieve and squeeze out as much water as possible
* Pop the onions, garlic and ginger into the pan with the butter, sizzle and stir for a few minutes until the onions have cooked though and are just starting to catch
* Add the chillis and spice mix, cook for another minutes or so
* Chop the spinach and add to the pan, stir for a few minutes  
* Add the soft cheese, stir for another minute and you're good to go 

## Result

Very garlicy, fresh, a meal in itself or a substancial side dish.  We had rice, a naan, mango and lime pickle.
