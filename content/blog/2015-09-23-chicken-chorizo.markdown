A week or so ago my friends [the two hungry boys](https://twitter.com/twohungryboys/status/643487361075122177) posted a salad with two different fried meats.  This sounds excellent.  I doubled up on the greenary and added a lemony dressing and... fried chicken skin as coutons and roast potatoes for a gluten free tea with a friend.  So good.


## You will need

* 4 chicken thighs.
* 6 inches of chorizo
* Potatoes.  I used some exciting multi-coloured heritage ones
* A bag of mixed green leaves
* Zest and juice of half a lemon
* A teaspoon of french mustard
* Vegetable oil.

## Do

1. Stick the oven on at 180  Pop a good slug of oil into a roasting tin and pop it in the oven
2. Chop your potatoes does to two inches or so
3. Slice the chorizo into round about twice the thickness of a pound coin, ideally on the angle
4. Rip the skin off the chicken, debone if needed and chop into pieces big enough to eat in one go.
5. The oven should be up to speed so pop the potatoes in the oil, shake them about and pop in the oven.
6. Stick the chozio and chicken skins into a frying pan and put on a gentle heat.  The aim here is to leech the oil from the sausage to fry the chicken skins and later the chicken in.
7. Once the chorizo is cooked through lift them out so they don't burn.  Keep the chicken skins going until you're ready to go.
8. Once the potatoes are nearly ready it's time to bring it all together.  Zest the lemon onto the salad and mix the lemon juice with the mustard.
9. The chicken skin should be crispy, lift them out onto a piece of kitchen roll and add a pinch of salt.
10. Turn the heat up on the pan and add the chicken into the fat and sizzle until cooked.  
11. Add the chorizo back to the pan and stir round. Pour off the fat.
12. Chop the chicken skin into pieces the size of a stamp.
13. Sling the mustard and lemon into the pan and stir round.
14. Pile everything together.  Top with chicken skin.


## Results

The lemon helps cut through the grease, the chorizo is spicy and delicious, the chicken skin is crispy and salty.  Seems like a faff to make, actually very easy.

Moe dressing would have been good.
