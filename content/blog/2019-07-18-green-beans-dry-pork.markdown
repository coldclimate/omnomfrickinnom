A quick writ eup for a quick tea.  I had a big bag of green beans that I neeed to use up and some diced pork shoulder in th freezer.  I really like dry fried bowls where everything is mixed rather than being "something on rice" or "such and such with noodles"

## You will need

* A handful of green beans, trimmed and cut into inch long pieces
* A handful of diced pork (1 inch dice)
* A couple of teaspoons of soy
* A teaspoon of [Lao Gan Ma Crispy Chilli in Oil](https://amzn.to/2GkDxcZ)
* A teaspoon of the syrup from a jar of stem ginger
* A teaspoon of fish sauce
* A handful of peanuts
* A few mint leaves finely snipped
* A couple of cupfuls of cooked lentils

## Do

* Mix the pork, soy, ginger, chilli and fish sauce and set aside for a few hours
* In a big frying pan or wok fry the greanbeans in a teaspoon of oil until they're cooked though and a touch browned
* Add the pork and cook until cooked though
* Add the lentils and the peanuts
* Keep it all moving until the peanuts take a bit of colour
* Spin the mint over the top

## Result

Tasty, you can eat it with just a fork, the pork should be cooked though but not tough.
