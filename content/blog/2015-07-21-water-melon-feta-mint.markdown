This seems really odd but was really good and an excellent way to use the heat when you put the BBQ on.

## You will need

* A couple of slices of watermelon (very ripe)
* Feta
* Mint leaves
* Rock salt


## Do

1. Make sure the melon is very ripe (I stuck it in a bag with a couple of bananas to make the most of the XXXX effect)
2. Get the BBQ seriously hot
3. Cook the melon until the flesh starts to blister and caremalise.  The photos don't do it business.
4. Cool as quickly as possible.  I stuck it all in the freezer.
5. Dice melon and feta.  Finer than I did.
6. Mix with rock salt and fine chopped mint leaves.


## Results

Sweet and savoury.  The melon is surprisingly meaty.  Seen here with some fast and hard grilled lamb.
