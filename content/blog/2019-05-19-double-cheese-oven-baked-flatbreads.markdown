Reasonably often we make flat breads, pile them full of tasty things and hot sauce and at them with our faces.  It might be a bit formulaic, but it's always tasty.

Tonight's version was partly a way to use up some of the 3 litres of yoghurt I made, as well as an excuse to have double cheese!

## You will need

### Flatbreads 

* 200g of white bred flour
* Roughly 200 ml of plain yoghurt
* A bit pinch of salt

### Roast things to go in the flatbread

* A sweet potato (diced rouchly 2cm)
* A courgette (diced rouchly 2cm)
* A couple of sweet peppers (halved)
* A handful of baby tomatoes
* A block of halloumi (cut into fat fingers)
* A handful of feta
* A handful of snipped coriander
* Hot sauces
* Pomegranate molasses

## Do

* Pop the oven on 180
* Toss the sweet potato in a teaspoon of olive oi and stick it in the oven on a non-stick pan
* Toss the rest of the veg and the hallumi in oil with a heavy pinch of salt
* After about ten minutes, add the veg and halloumi to the roasting tin
* Meanwhile mix and kneed the flour, salt and yoghurt to a smooth dough
* Divide the dough into four
* Roll each ball out as thin as possible
* Pop the breads into a dry hot frying pan one at a time, turning them if they start to catch, they puff up beutifully
* Once everything in the oven is crispy take it out of the oven and mix in the drained feta
* Pile everything in the breads, top with yoghurt, coriander, hot sauce and a drizzle of pomegranate molasses

## Result

Tasty, crunchy, squishy, salty, spicy and vegetarian.
