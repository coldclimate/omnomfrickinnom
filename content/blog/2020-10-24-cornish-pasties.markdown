I love a Cornish pasty and a pair make a great tea.  I used beef mince because it's what I had in, next time I'd probably use very finely sliced steak.

## You will need

* 500g strong bread flour
* 130g cooking fat (I used baking block, next time I'd use lard and a little butter)
* Cold water
* Teaspoon of salt
* Beef mince (about 300g)
* An equal amount in volume to the beef of
* * Potato (fine diced)
* * Diced turnip
* * Diced onion
* A handful of fine sliced leek green tops
* Worcestershire sauce
* Salt and pepper (I used celery salt because it's extra savoury)
* An egg

## Do

* Rub the fat, salt and flour until it's like breadcrumbs
* Add in enough cold water to make a smooth dough
* Pop it in the fridge for a few hours
* Mix the rest of the ingredients (except the egg) in a bowl and mash it up so it's well mixed, I should have added a couple of tablespoons of water to loosen it up a bit.
* Once you're ready to cook...
* Pop the oven on 200
* Roll out circles of dough, I used a soup bowl as a template
* Put a blob of the filling in the middle of the dough, then fold over and nip shut
* Pop them on a baking tray and brush with egg
* Bake for 20 minutes on high
* Turn the heat down to 140 and then bake for about another 30 minutes
* Best eaten when left for 20 minutes or so for the pastry to soften a little

## Result

The pasty is smooth on the outside with a satisfying crunch but a pliable texture.  The filling will have cooked down but the steam should have puffed the pastry out.  The veg should be cooked though but still distinct.   There's a certain smell to Cornish pasties that you don't get with anything else and I suspect it's down to the pastry.

Ignore the veg in the last photo, that was an experiment I'd not try again.
