## You will need

* Some lamb portions (lamb neck in my case)
* An onion (sliced)
* A block of frozen ginger
* A block of frozen garlic
* A few blocks of frozen spinach
* 2 heaped teaspoons of curry paste
* A bay leaf
* A stock cube
* A big cup of rice


## Do

* Stick the InstantPot on saute and brown the lamb and onion
* Stir in a heaped teaspoon of spice paste and sizzle for a few minutes
* Add 3x the volume of rice of hot water an the stock cube
* Pressure cook for 10 minutes and leave to cool
* Pull the meat off the bone or chop into bite sized pieces
* Once you're ready for dinner, add the spinach, bay and rice 
* Cook on "rice" setting
