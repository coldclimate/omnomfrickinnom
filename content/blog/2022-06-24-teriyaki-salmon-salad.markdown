A super quick tea that I felt was worth a write up.  This went from the bag to my face in less than 15 minutes, thanks to microwave rice and fish under the grill.

## You will need

### For the salmon

* A salmon fillet per person
* A teaspoon of honey
* A teaspoon of sesame oil
* A couple of cloves of garlic minced
* A tablespoon of soy

### For the salad

* A pack of microwave rice
* A handful of tomatoes, fine diced
* A few inches of cucumber finely diced
* A pepper finely diced
* A bag of mixed leaves, chopped a little
* The seeds from half a pomegranate
* A teaspoon of honey
* 2 teaspoons of soy
* 2 teaspoons of a sharp vinegar (I used rice vinegar)

## Do

* Mix up the salmon marinade and stick the salmon in it
* Pop the rice on to microwave.  When it's done, pop it on the plates, you want it cool, not red hot.  Don't reheat rice, that way lies food poisoning.
* Pop the grill on high to heat
* Pop the salmon under the grill, skin side down, without the marinade
* Whilst the salmon cooks, chop all the veg
* Whisk up the salad dressing and mix with the salad
* Turn the the salmon over, pile some of the marinade and it's garlicky bits on the top, and cook until the skin is crisp
* Serve by piling it all on top of rice

## Result

Delicious, salty, garlicky, super colourful, super quick.
