I love a real Christmas cake, a dark fruit cake, slightly too soft, a little booze, and disproportionatly more mazipan than strictly neccessary.   This year I decided to to follow the very excellent [Completely Perfect by Felicity Cloake](https://amzn.to/364KetJ).  

## You will need

A tonne of ingrediants.  Buy The Cloake's excellent book and you can find the recipe [on the Guardian site](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2011/nov/17/how-cook-perfect-christmas-cake). 

The good news is that lots of the ingrediants you won't need all of the bag and now you're a cupboard full of delicious snacks and the ingrediants for things like {{< relref "2020-01-05-christmas-dried-fruit-tarte-tatin.markdown" >}} 

Use a decent bottle of booze.  I picked up a bottle of [Cardhu Gold Reserve Single Malt](https://amzn.to/2NEYJhr) when it was on offer and even though I used a good cup full on the cake, regret nothing.

## Do

Give yourself plenty of time.  The cake will improve with age.  I started in mid November, which was too late really.

Don't cut the fruit too small, especially the figs.

Use a good jam under the marzipan.  I used apricot.

## Result

Moist (I should have given it another 5 minutes in the oven), rich, sticky in places and with the odd crunch from the almonds (I had my doubts, but they were great.)  It'll keep for months, but I imagine we'll have finished outs by February.
