Many years ago this was made on Blue Peter and from that point on it became a family favorite and Christmas tradition.  Famously one of my elderly relatives absolutely refused to share the piece we gifted her each year.

Yes, these days it probably just looks like rocky road, but that wsn't a thing in 1987, don't ruin my childhood.


## You will need

* 85g of sugar
* 85g of butter
* A heaped tablespoon of cocoa powder
* 230g of shortbread biscuits (broken into pieces that would sit on a teaspoon)
* A bag of marchmallows (slipped into bits that would also sit on a teaspoon)
* An egg
* Icing sugar for dusting


## Do

* Before you start cut out a big piece of baking parchment, probably about the width of the roll and a foot across.  Shake a little icing sugar onto it.
* Melt the butter and sugar in a pan on a low heat, stirring, don't let it catch or caremelise
* Stir in the cocoa powder and let it bubble a little
* Stir in the egg, vigously stirring 
* Take the pan off the heat and let it cool a little.  You don't want the marchmallows to melt when they go in (too much)
* Add the biscuits and marshmallows
* Stir until they're all coated
* Pour out onto the paper and shape into a log (I used a couple of books to help keep the shape)
* Let is cool (I stick it in the garage over night)

## Result

Slices roughly a centimeter across it's dark and chocolatly, crunchy and spongy, and very 1980s TV Christmas.
