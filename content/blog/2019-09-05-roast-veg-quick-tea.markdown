Tonight was one of those nights where I wanted something quick, tasty and passingly healthy.  "Vegetable corner" of the kitchen looked like it needed a clearing out, so it was a good excuse to roast it all.  Originally it was going to be mixed in with pasta but recently we bought a handful of packets of microwavable lentils and grains, so I stirred one of those thought too.   You can could swap in lots of different vegetables, adjust the time they go in.

The other notable thing here was garlic butter.  You could use olive oil and a clove or garlic, but I've a jar of confitted garlic cloves that I made last year when I had far too much garlic, so I'm having a use up of that too (and it's delicious).

Oh, and there was halloumi, which is always welcome. 

## You will need

(I'm listing the vegetables I used, but mix it up as needed)

* A handful of titchy tomatoes, whole
* A couple of peppers, cored an cut into 2cm chunks
* A big red onion cut into 32 pieces
* A block of halloumi cut into 1.5cm cubes
* A couple of heaped teaspoons of garlic butter
* A packet of ready made grains (a bit like these ones)[https://amzn.to/2LkYRlq]
* A handful of fresh herbs (I used up some sprouting parsley, a few mint leaves and some soft leaf thyme) finely chopped
* A blob of plain yoghurt
* A splash (a scant teaspoon) of wine vinegar (of fruit vinegar, something to take to edge off the fat)

## Do

* Pop the oven on 180oC
* Dump everything except the grains, herbs, vinegar and yoghurt into a roasting tin (yes, another excuse to break out the (Le Creuset Roasting Tin)[https://amzn.to/2LoQAx7])
* Roast until it's all golden and softened and delicious
* Dump the lentil packet in, give it a stir and return to the oven for 5 minutes
* Serve with the vinegar, herbs and yoghurt on the top

## Result

Gooey, golden, carmelised bits, burnt bits, cheesy bits, sharp spicy bits, earhty healthy bits.  Comfort in a bowl.
