The Caribbean combo of thyme, allspice, habanero, nutmeg and cloves always remind me of sunshine and good times, and when I first saw Levi Roots making Pepper Pot stew on TV years ago, I really wanted to try it.  His enthusiasm for food was infectious.

I used lamb neck, cooked on the bone, for extra flavour.  The recipe is a bastardisation of one from the BBC, adopted for what I had in the cupboard.  I'd slide a tin of butterbeans in there if I had them.

This is easily cooked in any pot, I used my InstantPot because it was easy.


## You will need

* About 400g of beef or lamb. Not too fatty
* An medium onion, peeled and sliced
* A few spring onions, finely sliced
* A sweet pepper (mine was yellow), sliced into 2cm squares
* A large sweet potato, peeled and cut into 1cm cubes
* A handful of fresh thyme
* 6 allspice, crushed
* 10 black peppercorns, crushed
* 2 bay leaves
* A piece of ginger as big as my thumb, finely sliced
* 3 cloves of garlic, finely sliced
* A tin of coconut milk
* A stock cube
* A teaspoon of Marmite
* A handful of frozen spinach or a bag of fresh spinach
* Habanero chillis.  I used one big and 3 small.  It was very hot.
* 200g of plain flour




## Do

* Brown the meat in a few teaspoons of oil in a hot pan until well browned
* Add the spices, garlic, ginger and onions (not the spring onions)
* Stir and sizzle for a few minutes
* Add the coconut milk, stock cube, 600ml of boiling water, and the Marmite
* Reduce the heat to a gentle rolling boil and cook for 30 minutes or until the meat is pretty tender.
* Mix the flour with enough water to form a stiff dough
* Add the sweet potato and teaspoon sized blobs of dough
* Top up the water if needed
* Cook for 10 minutes and then add the spinach,
* Cook for another 10 minutes or until the dumplings and potato are cooked

## Result

Smells like summer, hot as hell (which is great on a hot day weirdly), there's plenty of chunks for your fork and enough "soup" that some rice won't go a miss.
