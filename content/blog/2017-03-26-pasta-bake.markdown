I wasn't going to blog about this but the photos attracted some attention on twitter, so I'm knocking it out quickly.  The trick here is using a metal oven tray, promoting stuck on savoury bits.  It's not suer quick, but it is worth it.  The veg I used was a bit of a use up, you could probably chuck a tonne of stuff in here.  

## You will need

* A couple of inches of chorio, finely diced
* Beef mince
* Half a stock cube
* A carrot, grated
* An onion, finely diced
* 3 cloves of garlic, finely sliced
* Half a courgette, fine diced
* A handful of tiny tomatoes
* A good slug of pasata
* A slug of red wine or beer
* Pasta shapes.  I used a mix of white and brown tubes to have a use up
* A good handful of grated cheese.  I had a use up

## Do



1. Soften the onion, carrot, garlic and courgette in a pan with a blob of butter or some oil until the onion is translucent
2. Add the chorio and mince, stir until well browned  
3. Add the rest of the ingrediants except the pasta, turn the heat up
4. Turn the oven on 180
5. Keep stiring the ragu, it'll be about 20 minutes until the sauce thickens
6. Add a mug of boiling water and the pasta.  Stir to mix and then pour into a metal oven tray.  You'll aiming for about an inch and a half deep
7. Top with cheese
8. Bake for about 20 minutes


## Result

Reducing the sauce only to water it down again seems weird, but the first reduction helps break doown the veg and gives a velvet finish.  The metal tray helps give good stuck on crispy bits.

Only the one photo I'm afraid.
