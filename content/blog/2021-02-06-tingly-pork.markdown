I love Chinese meals of rice, greens and meat.  This months meatbox had a lovely slab of pork belly in it so I got to scratch my itch and try using the Unknown Tingly Green Sauce I last had it in [Tingly Chinese Chicken]({{< ref "2021-01-14-tingly-chinese-chicken.markdown" >}})

Right now there are huge bags of "greens" in the supermarkets.  They're super cheap (80p for a kilo) and perfect for braising

## You will need

### For the braised greens

* A big handful of greens, washed but left on stem
* A splay of soy
* A few lemon wedges
* A big pinch of ginger
* A splay of sherry
* A clove of garlic, peelsed but whole

### For the tingly pork

* A piece of pork belly, cut into rouchly 1 inch pieces
* A heaped teaspoon Laoganma or other chilli flakes in oil
* A heaped teaspoon Tingly Green Sauce
* A sping onion finesly sliced


## Do

The greens take about 5 minutes, the pork about 30, the timing is a bit frantic.

* Air fry the pork at 180 for about 30 mimnutes or until its crispy and cooked though
* Pop all the ingrediants for the greens in a large pan with a lid, along with a cup of boiling water on a medium heat
* Once the pork is ready, mix it with the Tingly Green, Laoganma and spring onions
* Heat the pork though in a pan until it' all melted
* Serve


## Result

The pork is cripy and juicy (air fryer magic) and literally lip tingling.
