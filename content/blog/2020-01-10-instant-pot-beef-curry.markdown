The more I use the Instant Pot, the more I appreciate being able to easily use different cooking techniques without doing more washing up.  Recently I've used it a few times to make curries and uncovered the left-right-left of Instant Pot cookery: saute - pressure cook - saute.

The first saute browns onions and meat, making sure you don't have anemic dish.  The pressure cooking tenderises meat and results in a great sauce texture from the onions.  A final saute then reduced the liquid content to get the right final consistency.


## You will need

### For the beef curry

* A big hanfdul of beef stewing steak cut into 1cm chunks
* An onion, roughly chopped
* A tablespoon of garlic (I used a frozen block)
* A tablespoon of ginger (and another block)
* 4 blocks of frozen spinach
* A big handful of baby tomatoes
* A small spoonful of chilli pickle (I used [Mr Vikki's King Naga ](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Mr-Vikkis-King-Naga/dp/B005MWW3K6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?crid=UWKNG0NMHUDA&keywords=king+naga&qid=1578254830&sprefix=king+naga,aps,172&sr=8-2&linkCode=ll1&tag=wwwcoldclimat-21&linkId=e128dddcf8b68686c7d230cb4073f80a&language=en_GB))

### To serve

* A couple of naan breads
* A couple of big spoonfuls of plain yoghurt
* A couple of big spoonfuls of mango pickle
* A load of snipped corriader
 

## Do

* Saute the beef, onion, garlic and ginger for about ten minutes
* Stir in the pickle, tomatoes and spinach
* Pressure cook for ten minutes
* Let the pressure out
* Saute for ten minutes
* Grill the naans, smear with mango pickle, top with curry and then more yoghurt


## Result

The onions have broken down to a velevety finish, the beef is tender, the spicies come though without screamingy hot.
