I saw somebody on twitter posting about making white fish in a parsley sauce and their memories to bland boil in the bag from the 1990s.  I don't remember those (and I didn't get school dinners), and I have tonnes of parsley growing at the moment, so I figured I'd give it a go.

Rather than making the sauce and then cooking the fish in it I decided to poach the fish in the milk and then use the milk to make the sauce.

## You will need

* a piece of fish each.  We had a couple of piece of Pollock from [FishBox](https://www.fishbox.co.uk/).
* Enough milk to cover your fish in a small pan
* A slice of butter off the block, about half a centimeter
* A big heaped teaspoon of plain flour
* A couple of teaspoons of horseradish sauce, or a little grated horseradish
* A small bunch of parsley, finely chopped
* A bay leaf



## Do

* Heat the milk, horseradish and bay together until the milk it too hot to put your finger in but not boiling
* Slide the fish in, cover and poach for ten minutes or so, turning the fish once, until the fish is cooked though
* Lift the fish out, keep it to one side (I pop it on a plate and then pop another one over the top to keep it warm)
* Pour off the milk into a jug and wash the pan
* Melt the butter, add the flour and cook until it's starting to brown (don't panic if it clumps up)
* Gently add the milk back, stirring all the time
* Once it starts to come together and thicken add the parsley and salt to taste
* Add back the fish, turn the heat down and cook for a few minutes
* Remove the bayleaf and serve (I added peas and airfrier roast potatoes)


## Result

Gentle, subtle and comforting.  Horseradish sauce was a little sweet, next time I'll use raw horseradish.
