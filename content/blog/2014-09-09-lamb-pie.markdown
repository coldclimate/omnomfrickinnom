After a rather excellent roast of lamb shoulder (from [Cranstons](http://www.cranstons.net/)) we had a load of cold lamb left over.  Rather than a quick curry we made spiced lamb pies instead.  Theres a lack of photos I'm afraid.


## You will need

### The pastry
* 125g of mixed brown and white plain flour
* 50g cold butter
* cold water (about 30ml but I did it by eye)

### The filling

* Cold lamb chopped into inch cubes (I removed most of the cold fat)
* half a large sweet potato chopped into hlaf centrimeter cubes
* large spoonful of curry paste (Patak's Vindaloo in this case)
* a slug of boilng water



## Do

1. Rub the butter and flour together unti it looks like breadcrumbs.
2. Add cold water a little at a time kneeding until you get a smooth pliable dough.
3. Stick the pasty in the fridge
4. In a large pan stick in all the filling ingrediants and start on a medium heat under a lid
5. Left the filling bubble away undil the lamb starts to break down
6. Take the lid off and left it reduce until it's slightly more runny than you'd want a pie filling, then take off the heat and leave to cool.
7. Roll our your pasty, rememmber you'll need spare for the lids.
8. Line pie tin(s).  There's no need to grease them, especially if they are reasonably non-stick.
9. Once the filling is cool enough to stick your finger in, fill the pie tin(s) and roll on the lids
10. Bake at 180o for about 20 minutes.
