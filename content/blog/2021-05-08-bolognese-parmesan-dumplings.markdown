Mince and dumplings are great (I've written about how much I enjoy [savoury mince and dumplings]({{< ref "2021-01-16-savoury-beef-mince-dumplings" >}})).  Beef bolognese is great.  At some point, somebody combined the two.  I don't know who.  I first saw it on the Instagram feed of those [Two Hungry Boys](https://twohungryboys.uk/) 

I've written up the dumpling recipe as I made them, using yogurt, but this was done on the fly when it turned out we had no milk.


## You will need

### For the bolognese

* 500g beef mince
* A large onion, finely diced
* 3 fat gloves of garlic, minced
* A tin of tomatoes
* A teaspoon of stock powder or a stock cube, I used vegetable
* A couple of teaspoons of olive oil
* A wine glass or so of beer
* A teaspoon of celery salt (or... a few sticks of celery finely diced)

### For the dumplings

* 1.5 cups of self-raising flour
* A big pinch of salt
* A couple of tablespoons of Greek yogurt
* About a tablespoon of grated Parmesan
* A handful of fresh herbs, finely snipped.  I used basil, oregano and thyme, because that's what was around.

## Do

* Brown the beef in a casserole dish for a few minutes in the olive oil 
* Add in the onion and garlic, cook on for another 5 minutes or so
* Add the stock, celery salt, beer and tomatoes
* Once it's almost boiling, pop the lid on, turn the heat right down, and leave for a couple of hours, it should end up too liquid, don't panic.
* Stick the oven on 200
* Mix all the dumpling ingredient in a bowl to form a smooth dough.  Add a little water if needed/
* Add the dough to the top of bolognese, dividend up into golf ball sizes blobs
* Bake in the oven with the lid on for about 10 minutes
* Bake without the lid for about 10 minutes to brown the top


## Result

The slow cook of the bolognese leaves it rich, the dumpling mix sucks some of the extra liquid out, the yogurt gives the dumplings a shiny finish.
