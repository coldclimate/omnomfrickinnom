Second dish of the trip, this cooks up quickly because the hard to cook bits (the potatoes) are done in advance.

## You will need

* A couple of big potatoes
* A coupe of chorizo
* A medium sized onion
* Butter


## Do

1. Dice the potatoes and stick under boiling water for 5 mins
2. Drain and set aside.  They should be almost cooked through. Let them steam dry
3. Dice and brown the onion
4. Dice the chorizo into forkable chunks
5. Bag the cooled stuff you've prepared along with a couple of knobs of butter.
6. To reheat: keep it moving, as the chorizo leaks oil and the butter melts, the potatoes will fry.  Try to scrape bits off the bottom.


## Result
A non-stick frying pan would have been good.  It made an excellent breakfast.
