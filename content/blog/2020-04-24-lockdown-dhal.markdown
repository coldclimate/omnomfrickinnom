This week we got a great delivery from [Grainger Market](https://shop.graingerdelivery.com/), salad, fruit and an  Indian Cookbox from Hector Hall.  I've always loved dhal, it's great comfort food.  There's an excellent recipe in [Completely Perfect: 120 Essential Recipes by Felicity Cloake](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Completely-Perfect-Essential-Recipes-Every-ebook/dp/B07FDKV94Z/ref=as_li_ss_tl?dchild=1&keywords=the+perfect+cookbook&qid=1587827040&sr=8-6&linkCode=ll1&tag=wwwcoldclimat-21&linkId=fd3182b6927783c5bfaf709fba7464ec&language=en_GB)  which I adapted to use the magic InstantPot.  I used ground ginger because I was keeping my fresh ginger

## You will need

### For the sweet and sour pork

* An onion, the size of a cricket ball, finely diced
* 5 fat cloves of garlic, peeled and fine sliced
* 3 fresh chillis (I think mine were birdseye)
* A blob of butter the size of a gold ball
* A cup of yellow split peas
* A heaped teaspoon of black mustard seeds
* A heaped teaspoon of cumin seeds
* A heaped teaspoon of ground ginger
* A heaped teaspoon of salt




## Do

* Cook the onions and garlic on saute mode for a good ten minutes or so with the butter
* Add all the rest of the ingredients and stir and sizzle for a couple of minutes
* Add three times the volume of peas of hot water
* Pressure cook for 30 minutes
* Season (I needed about a teaspoon of salt)

## Result

Gently spiced, not quite smooth, just rich enough from the butter
