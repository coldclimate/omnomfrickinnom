I saw this on [Smitten Kitchen](http://smittenkitchen.com/blog/2014/09/cucumber-lemonade/) a few years ago and was reminded about it this week (a retweet I think).  The original recipe discards the skins of the cucumbers to create a much subtler colour and flavour.  I'm not a subtle person, so I included the lot.  I also made a cordial rather than straight lemonade.  It mixes well with soda water with a roast chicken Sunday lunch and I imagine it will be brilliant with gin and ice.

## You will need

* 2 large cucumbers
* A bag of unwaxed lemons
* About a cup of sugar


## Do

1. Wash everything.  I bought waxed lemons by accident so I poured a kettle of boiling water over them and rubbed dry with a tea towel
2. Dice the cucumber to make blending easier, then blend until smooth.
3. Sieve the juice.
4. Zest the lemons (I threw a lime in too).  I used the mandaline for speed.
5. Juice all the lemons
6. Bring a small amount of the cucumber juice to the boil and disolve the sugar.  Let cool.
7. Mix everything. Refrigerate.  I imagine it keeps about a week.


## Results

"It smells like Wimbledon".  1 to 8 with soda water is excellent.  I've yet to mix it with gin but I can't see it going wrong.
