Years ago, possibly on Junior Masterchef, I remember seeing a lass cook a dish with both smoked salmon and fresh.  My mum was horrified (what a waste!) and I was horriffied (I hated both ingrediants).  Luckily if you roll forward the clock some 20 years (at a guess) both those things will have changed, so when I remembered we'd got the end of a large pack of smoked salmon and wanted to cook something a bit more fancy than normal, it sprang back to mind.

Being both rich and a little greasy, a green salad with a sharp and punchy dressing helps cut through the fat and provides a nice foil.

There are several things not seen in the ingrediants photo, sorry.

## You will need

### For the salmon

* A couple of salmon steaks, I left the skin on
* A couple of slices of smoked salmon per steak
* A sheet of premade filo pastry per steak
* A blob of garlic butter (I cheated and used the ready mase Kelly Gold stuff which is excellent)

### For the salad 

* A bag of lambs lettuce
* Half a lemon
* A dash of olive oil
* A slice of nutty bread
* A blob of chimichurri sauce


### For the chimichurri sauce

This makes loads but it keeps really well

* A bunch of coriandor and an equal amount of parsley
* A couple of cloves of garlic
* Olive oil
* Wine vinegar (about a third of the volume of the oil)
* Bit of salt


## Do

1. Make the chimichurri first.  We have a jar in the fridge most of the time, it's great with steak and a million other thing.
2. Whizz all the chimichurri ingrediants smooth.
3. Skin the salmon
4. Trim the narrow end of the salmon and lay it on top some you have a single piece of uniform thickness so it cooks all at the same time
5. Wrap the salmon in a single layer of smoked salmon
6. Lay out a sheet of filo and pop the salmon on it
7. Roll, fold and tuck the filo is the salmon is enclosed
8. Add a teaspoon of chimichurri to the top and smear it across  
9. Pop in over at 180 for 15 minutes
10. Meanwhile, lightly toast the bread and leave to cool
11. Whisk the juice of the lemon with a slug of olive oil and a teaspoon chimichurri
12. Slice the toast into 1cm squares
13. Toss salad, toast, lettuce and salad dressing
14. Serve once the pastry is golden

## Result

Rich, fishy, cripsy, lemon offsetting the oil, the smokiness tempored by cooking.
