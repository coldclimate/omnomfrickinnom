Recently I've been cooking a lot of spiced spinach dishes.  It's a tonne of green vegetables, full of spicy goodness and if you squint you can convince yourself it's healthy.

This week I've had a near terminal case of manflu.  I also found 300g of blackpudding in the freezer that needed using up so I took a chance, and set about comparing these two great super foods.  It was... amazingly good.

## You will need

* Everything except the cheese in the XXXXXXXX
* Black pudding cut into thick rounds


## Do

* Follow all the steps in XXXXXXX other than those for the cheese
* Grill the blackpudding until crisp on the outside
* Reserve the fat that leeches out
* Stir the blankpudding and it's fat though the spinach sauce
* Gently heat it though for a few minutes


## Result

The spice of the blackpudding shines though.  The crispy edges retain their structure.  It's better than you imagine.
