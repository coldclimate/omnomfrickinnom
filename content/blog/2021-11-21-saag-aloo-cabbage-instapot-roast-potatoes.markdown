Tonight we had strong cravings for a dish rich in green vegetables and I remembered we had some potatoes and cabbage that needed using up.  Thus, time for some silly fusion cooking.  The potatoes get roasted in the airfrier, and you can use a pan for the rest but an InstantPot on Saute mode works brilliantly.


## You will need

* 4 large potatoes (diced to one inch, skin on)
* 6 blocks of frozen spinach (defrosted and squeezed)
* 6 big green cabbage leaves (finely sliced)
* 1 large onion (finely sliced)
* 2 pucks of frozen garlic or about 6 big cloves minced
* 1 teaspoon of chilli oil (I used a habinaro oil from a Chinese supermarket)
* 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil
* 1 tablespoon of punchpooram or similar whole spice mix, lightly ground (leave bits big wnough to pop when you bite them)


## Do

* Pop the onion and half the oil in the InstantPot on saute mode, low
* Cook until the onions are translucent, then add the garlic and continue cooking
* Mix the potatoes and the rest of the oil, then stick them in the airfrier on 180 for 25 minutes
* After 5 minutes add the spice mix to the garlic and onion
* After about 5 minutes add the spinach and cabbage to the onions and stir it all up
* Give it a stir every so often to make sure everything is getting cooked
* After 15 minutes the potatoes should be roasted and crispy and the cabbage and spinach should be cooked though
* Mix everything together, adding the chilli oil and serve with a big blob or too of mango pickle


## Results

Super garlicly, crispy, spicy, satisfying and almost healthy.
