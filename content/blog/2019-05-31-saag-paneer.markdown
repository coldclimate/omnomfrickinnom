After a busy week mostly fuelled by snacks and black coffee we needed a dinner full of vegatables than was also satisfying.  The combination of a tonne of spinach and cheese fitted the bill.
  

## You will need

* A kilo of fresh spinach
* 300g of paneer cut into 1.5cm cubes
* Half a large onion diced
* 5 cloves of garlic peeled and sliced
* A chunk of fresh ginger the size of your thumb peeled and grated
* 2 heaped teaspoons of garam masala
* 2 heaped teaspoons of Kashmiri chilli powder
* 1 heaped teaspoon of tumeric
* A tablespoon of butter
* A fresh chilli sliced

## Do

* Mix the chilli powder and tumeric with enough oil to make a thick paste
* Stir the cheese with the mix until everything is coated.  Leave it to one side
* Fry the onions, garlic and ginger in the butter on a low heat for about ten minutes until the onion is starting to carmelise
* Stick all the spinach in a collendar and pour over a kettle full of boiling water
* Snip the spinach though with scissors and press with a the back of a spoon to remove as much water as possible
* Stick the grill on really hot and put the paneer under it on a tin tray
* Add the garam masala and sliced chilli to the onions and stir 
* Add the spinach and about 100ml of hot water.  Stir lots
* Keep turning the cheese until the cubes are browned on most sides
* Stir it all together and cook it out for a few minutes

Serve with a big fluffy naan, a spoonful of mango pickle and a handful a fine snipped coriander
