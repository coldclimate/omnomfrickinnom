A super quick tea with lots colour, crunch and spice.  The rare steak melts in the mouth.


## You will need

* A small steak of of high quality as possible (this was a 300g filet between two)
* A block of noodles
* A big handful of beansprouts
* 3 spring onions, green parts finely slices, white parts sliced into battons
* 1 carrot grated
* A few inches of cucumber, cut into fine battons
* 1 red chilli finely sliced
* 1 teaspoon of runny honey
* 2 teaspoons of soy
* 1 teaspoon of fish sauce
* 2 teaspoons of toasted sesame seeds 
* Half a teaspoon of grazed ginger
* The juice of half an oranges
* A hard handful of peanuts, ideally unsalted but salted will be ok.

## Do

This is another dish tha all comes together at the end very quickly, so do the veg prep in adance

* Season your steak well with flaky salt and pepper and set on one side
* Whisk the honey, soy, fish sause, oil, ginger, chilli and orange juice well in a large bowl and set aside
* Pop the peanuts in a dry frying pan on a medium heat, keep them moving until toasted.  If you're feeling adventurious multitask with noodle cooking or even steak frying!
* If your noodles need boiling, pop them on and then dump them into cold water to refresh them.
* Dump the beansprouts, spring onion, carror, cucumber and noodles into the salad dressing and stir well
* Fry the steak in a hot pan for a couple of minutes either side until as well done as you like (in my case, rare)
* Let the steak rest for a few minutes
* Finely slice the steak and pile everything together

## Result

Sharpe, salty, umami rich, hot, sour, chewy noodles, melting steak, this is such a satifying eat.
