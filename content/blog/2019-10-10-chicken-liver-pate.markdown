I got a copy of Felicity Cloake's [Completely Perfect](https://amzn.to/2OA8sqI) for my birthday and I've been working through it for the last few months.  It's brilliant, you should absolutely buy a copy.  I've been trying to stick to the recipes too, rather than going too of piste.  The Cloake has put endless work into research, it seems a waste to not stick to it.

However, I was left in a quantry on this one.  My mum makes great pate (really great) and she swears by the inclusion of celary salt.  A weird ingrediant, that I only see in bloody maries, and it's not in recipe for [How to make perfect chicken liver pâté](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2012/nov/29/how-make-perfect-chicken-liver-pate).

In the end, I did include it, and I regret nothing.


## You will need

* The ingrediants for [How to make perfect chicken liver pâté](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2012/nov/29/how-make-perfect-chicken-liver-pate)
* Swap the salt for celery salt
* I didn't have any madeira so I used 50% sweet sherry, 50% brandy

## Do

* Follow the steps in [How to make perfect chicken liver pâté](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2012/nov/29/how-make-perfect-chicken-liver-pate)
* I added booze and cream to the pan with the livers and bubbled it up for a minute
* Remember to make sure the lid is on the blender and you've not fired pate up the wall
* Retain what's left in the sieve - it's a great cooks treat on toast.
* I cooked one ramkin for 20 minutes in a tray of boiling water to cook it through.


## Result

Deliciously smooth, just enough spice, rich without being greasy, wonderfully savoury.
