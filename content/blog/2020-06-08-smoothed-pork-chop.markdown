I love a pork chop, they're a much underated cut of meat.  There were a pair of them in our meatbox this month and I couldn't resist.  Next time I'll airfry them and cook the sauce at the same time so that I get the properly crispy fat without risking drying them out.


## You will need

* 2 pork chops, with fat, snipped though
* A medium white onion, sliced
* A tablespoon of vegetable oil
* A tablespoon of plain flour
* A teaspoon of fennel seeds
* A teaspoon of black pepper
* A tablespoon of cream
* 200ml of stock (I used the liquid stock concentrate)



## Do

* Pop the chops and half the flour in a bag, shake to coat and flatten them out a bit with a rolling pin
* Put the pan on a reasonable heat, add the oil and the chops.  Cook until the meat it gcooked though.  Crisp the fat if you can
* Pop the chops to one side and cook the onion down in the fat until golden but not crispy (10 minutes or so)
* Crunch the fennel and black pepper and add to the pan, sizzle for a few minutes
* Add the rest of the flour and cook out
* Add the stock and stir vigerously until it starts to thicken
* Add the cream and chops, reduce the heat right down and bubble together for a few minutes.  Try to not let it split like I did.

Serve with a starch and a green veg.  I went for nutty brown rice and peas, because they're so easily eaten with a spoon :D


## Result

The pork is juicey and the fat has that unctous gel texture.  The pepper and the aniseed of the fennel come though without over powering.
