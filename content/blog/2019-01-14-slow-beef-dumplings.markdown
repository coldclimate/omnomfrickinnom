Yep, it's still winter, so it's still legally required to eat stew once a week.  Shin beef always slow cooks brilliantly but the probelm is you can't do dumplings in the slowcooker (I've not tried it yet anyway), thus this was slow cooked for 8 hours, then finished in the oven.

I made a huge batch of mirepoix a few months ago and it's great for things like this.  I grate it rather than the classic French dice because it's a faff.


## You will need

### Mirepoix

Grate equal amounts of onion, carrot and celary.  Mix it well.  I freeze it.


### For the stew and dumplings

* A chunk of shin beef, about 500g, in rough 1 inch cubes
* A couple of decent sized shallots, peeled and halved
* A bottle of porter (500ml or so) I used a Sainsbury's own
* A clove of garlic, smashed up a bit
* A big handful of Mirepoix (see note)
* A couple of teaspoons of oregano
* 100g of selfraising flour (I used brown, this was a mistake)
* 50g of suet
* A pinch of salt

## Do

* Put the beef, shallots, beer, garlic, mirepoix and oregano in a slowcooker (I set mine to medium)
* WAIT 8 HOURS WHILST YOUR HOUSE SMELLS AMAZING AND YOU THINK YOU ARE STARVING TO DEATH
* Still the oven on 180
* If your slowcooker bowl is oven proof, congratulations, you win.  Otherwise, stick an ovenproof dish in the oven to warm up
* Mix flour, suet and salt with enough water to bind it.
* If you need too, decant the stew into the the oven proof dish 
* If you think there isn't enough liquid stir in a bit of hot water or maybe even some more beer
* Top with dumpling mix equally devided
* Stick in the oven without a lid for about 20 minutes


## Result

Comfort food.  Silken onions.  Tender beef.  Maybe a spoonful of flour would have helped thicken the sauce (add it at the very beginning, dust the beef with it)
