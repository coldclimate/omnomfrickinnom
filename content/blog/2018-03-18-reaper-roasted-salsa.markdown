I love hot sauses (see picture below of out fridge drawer) so when I saw a limited edition Encona sauce (already someting of a favourite brand) I couldn't resist it.  We'd been planning on making salsa for a lazy afternoon so I thought it might be fun to combine the two.  I normally include a fresh chilli in my salsa but decided to swap it out for a healthy dose of Encona instead.

## You will need

* A handful of ripe tomatoes
* An equal numbr of small sweat peppers
* A tablespoon of fresh soft leafed thyme
* A tablespoon of Encona Carolina Reaper sauce

## Do

Pop the grill on super hot
Arrange the tomatoes and peppers in a single layer
Grill until the skins blacked, turn the peppers half way though
Slice the flesh off the peppers
Mash the peppers, thyme, tomatoes, hot sauce and a good pinch of rock salt. 
Let is go stone cold before eating


## Result

Hot and sharp with a great sweet background from the peppers and the Encona sauce.  The thyme adds a hint of jerk about it.  Excellent dipping salsa.
