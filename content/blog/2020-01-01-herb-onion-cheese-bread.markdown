I remember this from growing up, but didn't know where it came from.  A bit of googling suggests it was probably from [Nigella Christmas](https://amzn.to/39rUzCW).  The original recipe calls for snipped sage leaves.  I replaced those with a couple of heaped teaspoons of dried mixed herbs I had in.

## You will need

* A large onion, roughly chopped (about 350g)
* An equal weight of self-raising flour
* 100g of strong cheddar (grated)
* 1 teaspoon of salt
* 1 teaspoon of mustard powder
* An egg
* Enough milk to bind to a soft dough (about 100ml or so) 
* A couple of teaspoons of olive oil


## Do

* Stick the oven on 180 oC
* Fry the onion in the oil under soft and golden with the odd bit that's caught.  Ideally leave to cool
* In a large mixing bowl, mix the onion with dry ingredients
* Add the eg and some of the milk, mix until it all comes together.  You will probably need more of the milk.  try not to work it too much.
* Form the dough into a ball and drop it onto a baking tray
* Push a knife almost all the way though to divide it into 8 with deep slashes
* If you've spare milk, brush the outside with it.  I also pushed a couple of spare olives into the top.
* Bake for roughly 40 minutes.

## Result

Crunchy on the outside, soft inside, much like an armadillo.  Best eaten warm, but not straight from the oven.
