After a trip to Wagamammas this weekend I realised I'd not had miso in ages, and my donburi had some excellent sweat sticky chicken.  I thought the combo of the two would be rather good.

## You will need

* A chicken breast per person
* A packet of miso soup base
* Teriyai sauce mix (I used a very thin one)
* Honey
* Broccoli
* Root ginger, an inch or so fine sliced.
* Spring onions, a handful fine sliced

## Do

1. Pop the miso and sliced ginger into a pan with a few cups of boiling water and bring back to a gentle boil
2. Add the chicken breasts.  They  will poach through in a few minutes
3. Mix a teaspoon of honey and the teriyai sauce
4. Lift the chicken out and set to one side to cool
5. Slice the stem of the broccoli thinly and separate the florets
6. Slice the chicken a cnetimeter thick, pour over the mix and pop into a hot dry frying pan.  Bubble until chicken has absorbed the liquid and gone sticky
7. Drop the broccoli and spring onion into the still boiling miso mix.  Boil for two minutes.
8. Assembe with chicke in a bowl.  I added kimchi and chilli flakes in oil


## Result

Super savoury, umami rich, chicken is tender and sticky, broth rich and satisfying.  I should have chopped broccoli smaller.
