It's that time of the year (that most wonderful time of the year) where you can completely justify eating comforting food. 

## You will need

* 3 decent quality sausages per person (I used the Italian jobs from the [most excellent Block'n'Blottle](https://blocknbottle.com/))
* A medium onion per person (halved and then quartered)
* A measure of sherry/masala/glass of wine/beer
* A bay leaf
* A tablespoon of plain flour
* A blob of butter (25g maybe)
* Half a stock cube

## Do

* Pop the sausages and butter in an oven suitable pan on a medium heat
* Cool under the sausages have some colour and then remove, keep them to one side
* Pop the oven on 180
* Stick the kettle on
* Add the onions and bay leaf to the pan, reducing the heat
* Cook the onions until browned but still juicy.  Takes about ten minutes
* Add the flour, turn the heat up, stir lots
* Once the flour has cooked out a bit add the stock cube and the booze
* Stir stir stir!
* Add enough water to make a reasonable watery gravy (or wine/beer if you're using it)
* Add the sausages back and stick it all in the oven under thickened and the sausages are cooked through (about 20 minutes)
* Stir the skin in 
* Serve with your favorite carbs (bread for me, natch), and a serious dose of blackpepper


## Result

My perfect winter food.  Remember to fish out the bay leaf.  Thyme would also me good in here.
