We had a few courgettes that needed using up and I came across [a recipe on BBC Food](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/spiced-pea-courgette-fritters-minty-yogurt-dip) that I adapted to make a quick and tasty tea.

We ended up with a real mixed plate, with some avocados that needed using up and a mint raita made with a base of soft cheese not yoghurt.  There was also a big heap of baked red cabbage, sticky and sweet.


## You will need

* A couple of courgettes (grated and squeezed very well to remove the liquid)
* A big handful of peas
* A couple of eggs
* About 4 tablespoons of plain flour
* Half a teaspoon of ground corriander
* A teaspoon on cumin seeds
* A couple of teaspoons of lemon peel (I used some dried I had in the cupboard)
* A chilli, finely diced
* Vegetable oil for frying
* About a fingers width of feta, crumbled


## Do

* Squeeze the liquid out of the courgette as much as possible.  I did it in small handfuls and went through the whole bowl a few times
* Add all the rest of the ingrediants except the oil and feta and mix until it's stiff enough to hold it's shape.  Add the flour bit at a time is probably a good idea
* Put about a centimeter of oil into a pan and get hot.  It does't want to be smoking because the fritters will burn before they cook through.  It takes a bit of practice.
* Add blobs of the mixture to the pan, a big bigger than a heaped teaspoon or so.  Press them down when they go in so they stand a chance of cooking through.  I could get five in my 10inch pan
* Flip them over once they have coloured and set
* I had a plate under a low grill to keep them warm on
* When you're ready to serve, crumble a bit of feta over the top.

## Result

Next time I'll cook them in advance and then crisp in the oven/under the grill as the original article suggests, they went a bit spongy, but they taste great and the whole spices burst nicely when you bite into them.  I sprinkled a bit of [Scobo Oil](https://pippyeats.com/products/scobo-scotch-bonnet-chilli-oil) which is fiercly hot and contrasted nicely with the salty feta.

Guacamole and baked red cabbage made for strange plate-fellows, but I'd have hated them to go to waste.
