I'm continuing to work my way though Felicity Cloake's excellent [Completely Perfect](https://amzn.to/2OA8sqI) and for a Saturday night what's more fitting than [the perfect chicken tikka masala](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2014/apr/24/how-to-cook-perfect-chicken-tikka-masala) with [the perfect naan](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2014/oct/02/how-to-make-perfect-naan-bread-recipe).

Again, I tried to stick to the recipes.

## You will need

* Th ingrediants for [the perfect chicken tikka masala](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2014/apr/24/how-to-cook-perfect-chicken-tikka-masala)
* The ingrediants [the perfect naan](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2014/oct/02/how-to-make-perfect-naan-bread-recipe)
* I used a whole chicken rather than breasts and thighs, jointed and off the bone
* I didn't include the fenugreek leaves because I couldn't find them



## Do

* Follow the instructions
* The chicken needs prepping in the morning if you want to eat that evening
* The naan dough needs time to rise.  I cheated and used the breadmaker
* I also added the nigella seeds to the dough mix so the flavoutr permiates the whole naan
* Next time I'll BBQ the chicken to get a good char on the meat
* I'm willing to bet that the sauce would be better made and rested for a day.

## Result

The naan is difficult to get right, I might try rolling them thinner next time, getting them to cook though without burning is hard .  The chicken itself is delicious, juicy and sharp, it's a great marinade.  The source is a great texture.  Next time I might add a little more sugar, maybe a dark one.  I'd also reduce the sauce down a bit more.
