Starting the year as I mean to go on, this is quick and tasty.  Also it uses my awesome non-tick roasting tin for nearly no washing up.

## You will need

* A pack of puff pasty
* About 4 tablespoons of creme fraiche
* A shallot finely sliced
* A handful of chopped smoked bacon or pancetta
* A splash of milk


## Do

* Pop the oven on at 180oC
* Score the pasty round the edges about 4cm in.  This will rise and form the crust
* Prick with a fork the rest of the pastry.  Try not to go straight though but it doesn't matter too much if you do
* Brush the pastry which will be the crust with milk
* Pop in the oven for about ten minutes or until it's lightly coloured
* If it's puffed up jab with a fork and push the middle down
* Spoon creme fraiche into the middle and spread out
* Sprinkle the shallot and bacon over along with a good pich of flaky salt
* Return to the oven for 20 minutes or until it looks golden and tasty
* Serve with a sharply dressed salad to offset the richness

## Result

The onions brown, the bacon crisps, the creme fraiche melts odd bits brown.  Next time I'll stir some lemon zest and black pepper though the creme fraiche.  A drizzle of balsamic wouldn't have gone a miss.
