I love a steak and kidney pudding.  The rich filling, the drama of cutting into it and steam errupting out, the spongy case, there's so much to love.  Next time I've got a spare weekend I'll have a go to make one, but with the hours of steaming it's not practical for a midweek tea.  

I replaced the suet pudding with bread which is a surprisingly good substitute (and quick!) once again proving bread is a awesome replacement for pastry.


## You will need

* Steak and kidney mix.  I used a 300g pack
* A small onion
* a bay leaf
* a stock cube 
* a teaspoon of flour
* a squirt of tomato puree
* twice as much white bread as you think you'll need
* spreadable butter
* dijon mustard
* a tall sided pie tin

## Do

1. Brown the steak and kidney in a pan for a couple of minutes until everything is well coloured
2. Put the meat off to one side and then brown the onion (finely diced) in the same pan with a little more butter or oil
3. Once the onions are glossy and translucent add a teaspoon of flour, stir round ad cook for another minute or two.
4. Add the bay leaf, tomato, stock cube and meat.  Add half a pint of water. Stir and bring to a gentle boil
5. Gently simmer for about half an hour.  The steak should be tender, the liquid reduced to a thick gloss
6. Stick the oven on at 180
7. Spread the bread with a thin layer of mustard, then butter. Cut off the crusts.
8. Line the tin and then press firmly into the tin.
9. Spoon the filling into the tin and top with more bread.
10. Bake for about 20 minutes.  The top should be like overdone toast.
11. Serve by turning out, toast side down.


## Results

It's not steak and kidney suet pudding, but it is excellent.  The bread crisps a bit on the outside but swells in the middle to give that spongy texture that's so key.
