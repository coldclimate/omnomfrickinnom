This was an excellent tea made by my girlfriend, well worth a write up.  Pre-rolled pastry is a great shortcut to delicious dinners.


## You will need

* A pack of pre-rolled puff pastry
* Half a large onion (finely sliced)
* A pack of smoked salmon (great use of the cheap packs of offcuts)
* Half a small tub of soft cheese
* A big squeeze of lemon juice
* A good scattering of capers
* Egg if you're bothered about glazing the edge
* a slug of olive oil


## Do

* Softed the onions in a pan with the olive oil until translucent
* Let them cool a bit
* Add the soft cheese and lemon juice
* Bake the pastry on a sheet at 180 for a few minutes 
* Pile it all into the middle of the pasty and spread towards the edges, leave as much crust as you'd like
* Scatter with salmon and capers
* Egg wash the crust if you're into that sort of thing
* Return to the oven and bake until the edges are golden and the ctopping has a hint of char 

## Result

I'm sure this was meant to feed six but we didn't let that get in the way.
