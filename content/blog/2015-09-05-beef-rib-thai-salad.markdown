I love beef rib, but it does best when given a long and slow cook.  At some point I'll get round to doing some in the BBQ but until then, slow cooker it is.  I completely forgot to take pictures of this as I was making it, sorry.

## You will need

### for the beef

* A potion of beef ribs.  I had about a kilo, including the bone.
* Juice of a lime
* Zest of a lime
* A stick of lemon grass (fine grated or smashed up)
* Heaped desert spoon of garlic
* Same of ginger
* Same of chilli (I cheated and used pre-minced in a jar for all the above)
* Heaped teaspoon of Thai basil (jarred, again)
* A slug of light soy

### for the salad

* A fresh cob of corn
* A carrot
* A handful of sugar snap peas
* Heaped teaspoon of peanut butter
* A good slug of lime juice
* Same of seaseme oil
* A small spash of fish sauce
* Black pepper

## Do

1. Marinade the beef in all the other ingredients over night in a tight plastic bag in the fridge
2. Stick it all in the slow cooker along with a mug of water on low for 8 hours.  Try to arrange the beef bone down, fat cap up.
3. Slice the corn off the cob, the pea pods into 3s and the carrots into sticks (I made th mistake of rounds, looks ugly and too big)
4. Mix the dressing ingredients well, stir into the veg.
5. Serve.


## Results

The beef falls off the bone but has a spiced crust.  The salad is too crunchy and sour but goes brilliantly with the beef.

## Improvements

I got too much lime juice in the salad dressing.  A potion of noodles stirred through the salad would have been excellent.  The carrot was way too chunky.
