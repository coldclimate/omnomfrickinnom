This week I ran across (The Cury Guy's spicy chicken wings)[https://greatcurryrecipes.net/2018/12/13/spicy-hot-chicken-wings/] and couldn't resist.  Whenever I buy chicken breasts from (Block'n'Bottle)[https://blocknbottle.com/] the wing is still attached.  I tend to chop it off and drop it into a bag in the freezer, so when I crave wings they are good to go.  

Dan The Curry Guy recommends skinning the wings but... I love cripsy skin.  I normally airfry my wings and seen as the recipe suggested barbecuing the chicken, so I airfried it.

## You will need

* A handful of chicken wings, jointed
* A small onion finely diced
* A tablespoon of tomato paste
* A tablespoon minced garlic
* A tablespoon minced ginger
* A tablespoon of rapeseed oil/olive oil
* A teaspoon of cumin seeds (ground)
* A teaspoon of hot chilli powder
* A teaspoon of chopped coriander
* About 20 curry leaves
* 100ml boiling water
* A good squeeze of lime juice
* 

## Do

* Pop the onions and oil in a pan on a low heat to start carmelising
* Pop the wings in the airfrier at 180oC.  Shake them about every so often.  Take them out once crispy (probably about 15 mins)
* Once the onions are softened add the garlic, ginger and curry leaves
* Stir and cook for another 5 minutes
* Turn up the heat and add tomato, cumin and chilli powder, stir and sizzle
* Add the hot water and simmer whilst stirring
* Add the chicken wings and simmer and stir for another 5 mins, lid off
* Stir in the lime juice and coriander
* Eat!

## Result

The chicken skin remains crispy, the reduced onions make a thick and tasty sauce.  I had to eat them with a knife and fork not my fingers, but they were super tasty.
