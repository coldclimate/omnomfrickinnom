I love chicken wings and until recently I thought deep frying was the only way to get really crispy results.  I was wrong.  The combination of baking at two temperatures and a little baking powder makes all the difference.

## You will need

* A pack of chicken wings (about a kilo)
* Half a teaspoon of salt (I used celary saly because I'm a bit addicted)
* Half a teaspoon of baking powder
* A couple of teablespoons of hot sauce or BBQ sauce.


## Do

1. Separate the wings into their three sections.  Some people might discard the small wing tip
2. Put the oven on 120oC
3. Dry the chicken off if needed
4. Shake salt, baking poder and chicken in a carrier bag 
5. Put the chicken on a rack above a baking tray
6. Stick in the oven for about 30 minutes.  They should be only just coloured
7. Turn the oven up to 220oC
8. Flip them all over, popping any fat bubbles
9. Return to a high shelf in the oven for about 30 minutes
10. Pull them out of the oven and leave on the rack.  Try not to eat one
11. Put a good dollop of sauce in a big pan.
12. Stick it on the hob on a high heat until it's bubbling
13. Pile the chicken in, pop a lid on and shake vigioriously.
14. Serve (in this case with roasted brussel sprouts which I did becuse the oven was on)


## Result

The skin is crispy and covered in caverties, which the skin clings to.  The baking powder helps draw out the fat.  Being on the rack helps air circulate and crisp right round.  Turning them over hepls pop the fat bubbles.

[Reds Hot Sauce](http://amzn.to/2oPTFvg) was good, but those I did with a sweet BBQ sauce from [Hamaknockers BBQ](https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Restaurant_Review-g34156-d1892647-Reviews-Hamaknockers_BBQ-Crawfordville_Florida.html) were much much better.  Make sure you don't use too much baking powder or you'll get a funny "spinich" finish on your teeth.
