We had this as a main course (a huge pile of it) but it would make a good side dish.  It's super savoury, with all the boxes being ticked (sour, sweet, salty, spicy, stuck on bits, burnt bits, squidgy bits, everything).

I don't know if you need to "marinade" the squash, but I had the time and it didn't seem to harm it


## You will need

* A butternut squash, sliced into inch thick wedges
* About a tablespoon of gochujang (Korean pepper paste, looks for the red tub in your local asian shop)
* A block of feta
* About a teaspoon of honey
* A tablesoon of mixed seeds, often sold as salad toppers
* A good splash of lime juice


## Do

* Smear the slices of butternut with gochujang on both sides and set aisde.  I prepped them at lunchtime and cooked about six pm.
* Roast in an oven at about 160 for an hour.  Once it's cooked though and slightly burnt pull it out and leave it to cool whilst you make the feta
* Stick the grill on high
* Slice the feta into 1.5cm cubes and stick it on a sheet of tinfoil
* Stick the feta under the grill for about 5 minutes until it's starting to char
* Pour the honey over the top and return to the grill for a few minutes. Don't let it catch.
* Slice up the butternut into large cubes.  it'll be a bit squidgy
* Mix the feta and the squash
* Pile it up, scatter over seeds (these would have benefited from aminute under the hot grill) and a squeeze of lime
* We had seconds (unphotographed), piled onto thick, hot buttered toast, and it was excellent.
