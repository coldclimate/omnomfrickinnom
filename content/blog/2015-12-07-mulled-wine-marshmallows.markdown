This all started with a blagging Facebook post. "Nobody mulls wine as hard as I do" (because frankly if you're not making mulled wine in lab glassware on top of an open fire, you don't).  The author of [Absinthe for Adultery](http://absintheforadultery.tumblr.com/) called me on it however and then brought up the idea of mulled wine marshmallows.  

The next morning I found myself with two ingredients in the cupboard

1. A Sainsbury's Marshmallow Kit
2. Left over mulled wine*

Game on.


## You will need

I used a kit.  However the ingredients were pretty much as follows...

* 2 x 7g sachets powdered gelatine
* 450g caster sugar
* 50g icing sugar
* 50g cornflour
* 300ml of mulled wine, strained of bits


## Do

1. Heat 100ml of wine until steaming hot and ad the geletine.  Stir a lot, put over to one side
2. Bring the rest of the wine to a gentle boil and dump in the sugar, stir until dissolved
3. Reduce the wine slighty
4. With an electric whisk start whizzing the geletine mix in a bowl
5. Once it's starting to stiffen start dribbling in the hot wine.
6. BE SUPER FREAKIN CAREFUL, DON'T STOP TO TAKE SELFIES
7. Keep whisking until it forms peaks.  It'll loose some of the height as it sets so go for broke
8. Line cake tin(s) with clingfilm and dust liberally ith a mix of cornflower and icing sugar (cover every surface)
9. Pour the mallow into the cake tins and dust the top with more cornflower/sugar
10. Refrigerate for a good couple of hours
11. Tip out and peel off the clingfilm.  I found it easiest to tear the film where it was well dusted and then pulling it away firmly.  It's very sticky.
12. Cut into pieces.  You'll need to to dust the fresh cut edges to stop everything sticking.

## Results

Fluffy and surprisingly light.  As sweet as you'd image.  Great smell.  Next time I'd use port.
