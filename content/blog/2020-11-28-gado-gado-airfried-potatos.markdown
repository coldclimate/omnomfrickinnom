Gado gado is one of my favorite dressings, sour, sweet, hot, salty, deeply umami.  Rather than the usual noodles, I broke out the airfrier, and crisped a heap of potatoes.


## You will need

* A handful of green beans, trimmed and cut in half
* Potatoes, 2cm diced
* A couple of eggs, hard boiled and peeled
* A teaspoon of oil
* A tablespoon of crunchy peanut butter
* A tablespoon soy sauce
* A teaspoon of lime juice
* A quart of a teaspoon of shrimp paste (or a teaspoon of fish sauce)
* Half a clove of garlic, minced
* A teaspoon of sugar


## Do

* Cover the potatoes in the oil and stick in them in the airfryer
* Mix up all the other ingredients other than the green beans.  You might need to adjust the ratios a bit to your personal preference.
* When the potatoes are ready, boil the beans briefly and drain.
* Mix and serve
