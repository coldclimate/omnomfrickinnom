This year my gout has been really painful, to the point where I started a new side project [www.gout-is-shit.com](www.gout-is-shit.com).  I've also had to cut out from my diet all pork, offal, game, fish, shellfish, beer and whiskey.  Once it's under control I'll start adding things back in, but right now, I'm eating none of those things, which means not only am I missing pork chops, but also bacon, sausages, chorizo, ham, cured meats, venison, you name it, thus, I'm experimenting.

This week I've tried combining the spices used to make chorizo with turkey mince, rather than pork. The results are pretty tasty, if a little dry because of how lean the turkey mince is.


## You will need

* 500g of turkey mince.  I suspect it's breast meat minced, I'd be interested in other cuts.
* 2 heaped teaspoons of paprika, I used a well smoked one
* 2 heaped teaspoons of chilli powder
* 1 headed teaspoon of ground coriander
* 1 heaped teaspoon of cumin seed (ground)
* 1 heaped teaspoon of Mexican oregano (I ground it between my palms to break it up a bit)
* 1 level teaspoon of garlic granules (or a couple of cloves of garlic minced)
* 1 heaped teaspoon of brown sugar

## Do

* Mix everything well, use your hands to really emulsify it
* Refrigerate until you're ready to use it
* Shape and fry reasonably quick and hard, you don't want it to go dry.


## Results

Next time I'll double up the spice mix to make it really kick, but both as meatballs and fried in bigger chunks.  I used it in some Mexican style tacos and a burrito bowl.

Note, the tacos were actually made using Derbyshire oatcakes (needed using up) in some sort of horrific fusion cookery
