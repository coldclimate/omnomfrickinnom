A while ago I made a cheating version of one of my favourite Chinese takeaway dishes, [orange chicken]({% post_url 2014-11-11-chinese-orange-chicken %}).  Last week I made a lemon version and it was even better!  Follow the orange chicken instructions but use the following for the pour over/boil sauce.


## You will need

* 1 tablespoon of lemon curd (or whatever clings to the inside of a nearly finished jar)
* a chilli finely chopped
* the juice of half a lemon
* a splash of soy


## Do

1. Same as Orange Chicken, though this time I left the chicken in bigger chunks and it was better.



## Result

Sharp and sweet, crispy and salty, spicy and hot.
