Perfect for a cold day as the nights draw in, this used up some sausage meat in the freezer from last Christmas, some past their best parsnips and the last of my homegrown apples.  It's 5 minutes prep and goes straight from the the oven to the plate.

Swap in root veg as you need, onions and carrots would have worked well.


## You will need

* A pack of sausage meat cut up into forkable chunks or a pack of quality sausages cut up
* A couple of parsnips, scrubbed and chopped
* A couple of apples, chopped into chunks
* About the same volume of potatoes as you have apples and parsnips, chopped up a bit smaller than you might imagine them needing to be
* A couple of teaspoons of oil oil
* A heaped teaspoon of fennel seed
* A heaped teaspoon of mustard seed
* A few big fork fulls of sauerkraut


## Do

* Stick the oven on 180
* Toss all the veg in olive oil
* Pile everything into a non-stick oven tray
* Sprinkle the fennel and mustard seeds
* Bake for around 30 minutes or until everything looks crispy on the top
* Pile on plates with sauerkraut on the side (and some mustard)


## Result

The apple and parsnips are sweet, the sausage leaks fat that everything on the bottom fries in.  There are sticky and unctuous bits.  The fennel and mustard seeds pop as you bite them.
