Years ago I had crispy ginger beef in a restarunt in Vancouver.  I've never found anything quite as good, but I've an idea how to reproduce the beef now. This was very dark, sweet, morish.

## You will need

* Thin beef steak
* Cornflour
* Vegetable oil for frying
* Vegetables for stir frying.  I used baby sweetcorn, spring onion and a a chilli
* Sweet chilli sauce (a couple of tablespoons)
* Oyster sauce (a tablespoon)
* Dark soy (a tablespoon)
* Minced ginger (a tablespoon)
* A heaped teaspoon of honey
* Fresh lime juice



## Do

1. Slice beef into centimeter wide strips
2. Douse in corn flour
3. Bring oil to very hot
4. Start deepfrying the beef.  Once again this is a recipe where "when it's ready to come together it all happens very quickly"
5. Stir fry your veg
6. Once the beef is cooked (see photo) set aside in kitchen paper to drain
7. Push the veg to one side and heat a teaspoon of oil in one corner of the pan and turn up the heat
8. Dump in minced ginger and stir vigorously
9 Once the ginger has coloured add the other liquid sauce ingredients and sizzle to the boil
10. Add the beef and stir round.  Turn off the head and let it all sit for a few minutes so that the beef soaks up the sauce.
11. Spinkle with fresh lime juice to take the grease out of the mix.
12. Serve with rice.

## Results

The lime makes a big difference.  The deep frying dries the beef and makes it crispy, chewy and delicious. I got the sauce a bit too dark.  The amount of oil left in the pan after deepfrying suggests not that much has been absorbed by the beef.
