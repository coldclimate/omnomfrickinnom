I don't remember where I read this idea first, but roasting the lamb in a closed roasting tin keeps all the juices in means the potatoes cook in them getting sticky and delicious.  Very limited washing up and excellent reheated the next day

## You will need

* Enough potatoes to full the bottom of your roasting tin
* A chunk of lamb big enough to feed everybody
* Salt
* Olive oil


## Do

* Slices the potatoes roughly 3mm thick.  I used a mandolin.
* Pile them into the roasting tin and toss in a teaspoon of olive oil.
* Shuffle them round so they all sit level and all the slices from any potatoes aren't stuck together.
* Salt the lamb really well (more than you might think) because it will run off in the steam into the potatoes.
* Sit it on top of the potatoes,put the lid on and put it in a cold oven, set to 160.
* Keep an eye on it drying out, depending on the ingredients you might need to add a little (splash) of hot water.
* Cook for around three hours, taking the lid off for the last 20 minutes.
* When you're ready to serve, tear the lamb to bits, it should come off the bone if beautifully.

## Result

Eat it hot, lamb grease cools and it horrible.  The tops of the potatoes are crispy, sitting atop soft and unctuous cooked slices. The lamb is melt in the mouth, with the fat (if there is any) crispy and the outside oh so saltly.

We had a big smear of Mr Vikkis Roast Black Garlic Pickle and the heat offset the grease brilliantly
