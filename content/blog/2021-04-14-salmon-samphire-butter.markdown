## You will need

* A pair of salmon fillets
* Enough potatoes for two, cut into cubes
* A slice of a block of unsalted butter roughly 1am wide
* The juice and zest of half a lemon
* A teaspoon of capers
* A bag of samphire
* A sprig of thyme
* A big sprig of parsley
* A quarter of a clove of garlic
* Olive oil


## Do

* Shake the potatoes with a teaspoon of oil and stick in the airfrier on 180 for 20 minutes
* Drop the samphire into boiling water for 2 minutes and drain, set to one side
* When you're about ten minutes off the potatoes being ready, make the salmon
* Put a good slug of olive oil into a pan and once it's hot add the salmon in skin down (it should sizzle)
* Cook skin side down for a few minutes, then turn them over
* Turn the heat down and add the butter, thyme and garlic
* Add the lemon zest and capers, keep it cooking for a few minutes, pop the salmon on it's side if you need to to help it cook though
* Add the Parsley, samphire and lemon juice, stir round, cook for another minute or two
* Pile the potatoes into the middle of the plate, point the rest over the top.

## Result

Super savoury, lots of butter, salty and bitter, sweet fish.
