My friend knows I'm always interested in unusual food, so when you messaged me to see if I wanted a jar of "this tingy chilli oil that my wife loves and you can't get in the UK" I jumped.  He also gave me a recipe which I adapted given what we had in.

What arrived on my doorstep (because social distancing) was a jar of dark green oil with bits it that when I stirred it turned out to be slightly jellied.

I had a turkey thigh to use after defrosting a a couple, so I used it and the darker meat worked well, chicken thighs would have worked well too.

## You will need

* A turkey thigh or 2 chicken thighs, skinned and diced in 1 inch cubes (keep the skin)
* 1 big onion, cut into eight
* 1 desert spoon full each of ginger and ginger paste (or equivalent fresh and grated)
* 2 tablespoons of dark soy
* A tablespoon of Shaoxing cooking wine or in my case, dry sherry
* 1 inch of fresh ginger, peeled and cut into matchsticks
* A big pepper, cut into slices
* 2 heaped teaspoons of Laoganma chilli flakes in oil
* 1 teaspoon of Tingly Green Magic
* 1 teaspoon of sugar


## Do

* Put the onion and skin in a pan with a teaspoon of oil on a low heap to start cooking.  As the skin leaches oil you'll need to keep an eye on it
* In another pan put the minced garlic and ginger, soy, wine/sherry and a couple of cups of water, stick it on a high heat
* Once it's boiling add the meat and turn the heat down to just boiling and pop a lid on
* The meat will take about ten minutes to cook through.  Turn the heat off once it is but leave it in the liquid.
* Once the onions are mostly translucent with the odd one starting to catch remove the skin and add in the peppers and ginger, then stir it round for a few minutes
* Add the sugar, Tingly Green Magic and Laoganma. Give is a minute to start to heat though.
* Remove the meat from the cooking liquid and add.  Turn the heat off and give it a good stir round.
* A handful of peanuts here wouldn't have gone a miss.

## Result

Pretty hot, weirdly tingly, sweet finish.  Really very different.  The jar will last a long time.
