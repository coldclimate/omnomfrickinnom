I've written about shin beef chilli in the past, but when a big chunk of shin landed in our meatbox I couldn't resist giving it the InstantPot treatment.  The result was delicious and the process was different enough to warrant writing up.

## You will need

* A serious chunk of shin beef.  Mine was about a kilo, separated into it's primary muscles, diced into 1 inch cubes
* A tablespoon of plain flour
* A medium onion finely diced
* 2 heaped teaspoons of oregano
* 2 heaped teaspoons cumin seeds
* 1 heaped teaspoon of ground black pepper
* 1 heaped teaspoon of hot paprika
* 1 heaped teaspoon of hot chilli powder (or 1 fresh birdseye in my case)
* 2 big dried smoked chillis (mine were a Guajillo and an Ancho), sliced up
* 4 squares of dark chocolate
* 1 heaped teaspoon of quality instant coffee or a measure of fresh espresso
* 5 cloves of garlic, finely sliced
* An inch off a block of lard (about 50g)
* A tin of kidney beans, drained

## Do

* Soak the dried chillis in a mug of boiling water for about an hour
* Flour the meat, make sure it's well coated
* Pop the InstantPot on high heat saute
* Brown the meat.  It'll take about 10 minutes, you want a good colour.
* Add the garlic and the onion and continue sizzling for 5 mins
* Clear a space in the middle of the pot, let the fat pool and drop all the spices into it.  Sizzle for another minute or so.
* Add the mug of chillis (including the water), the chocolate and the coffee
* Switch the InstantPot to slowcooker for 5 hours.  Give it a good stir after an hour to mix it all.
* (Wait 5 hours)
* Remove the lid, saute for 10 minutes of so to reduce he liquid content if you need to.
* Season if needed.  Mine could have done with a touch of salt and lime.

## Result

Pictures speak louder than words.
