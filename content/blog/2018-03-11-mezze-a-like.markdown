I love meals which can be prepared in advance and with a little prep work come together like magic at the end.  This is one where everything benefits from a little marinading time.

## You will need

It looks like a lot of ingrediants, but it is for four dishes.

### For the hummous

* A tin of chickpeas
* A tablespoon of tahini
* A tablespoon of lemon juice
* 2 tablespoons of olive oil

### For the lamb chops

* 2 lamb chops per person
* 1 teaspoon of harrissa paste for each pair of chops

### For the halloumi

* A block of halloumi
* A small clove of garlic
* A tablespoon of olive oil

### For the couscous

* A couple of drid figs
* A handful of dried apricots
* A sprinkle of sumac


## Do

A tale in two parts

### The prep

1. Smear the lamb chops on one side with about half teaspoon of harissa paste each.  Pop on a plate to marinade and hide away from your cats.
2. Mash a small clove of garlic with a table spoon of olive oil
3. Slice the hallumi about a centimeter thick
4. Smear the cheese with the garlicy oil and leave to marinade
5. Drain the chickpeas and reserve about a quarter of the tin
6. Mash the rest in the same pestle and mortor you used for the garlic above
7. Add the tahini, lemon juice, olive oil and a pinch of rock salt
8. Mash until pretty smooth
9. Stir in the unmashed chickpeas in and give it a bash
10. Cover so it doesn't try out
11. Chop the apricots and figs, mix with the couscous and a good pinch of rock salt

### Brining is all together to serve

Once again, I broke out the air fryer!  It workked for pork chops, so lamb chops were the next step.

1. Stick the AirFryer on 200oC and let it get up to temperature
2. Pop the chops into the ArFryer in a single ayer (or standing on their edge)
3. Lightly oil a frying pan and put on a low heat
4. Put the halummi in to fry turning until golden
5. Pour twice the volume of hot water over the couscous
6. Serve liberally sprinking of chopped parsley
