I was very skeptical of [Fish Finger Bhorta](https://www.nigella.com/recipes/fish-finger-bhorta) when I first saw it, not because of the fish fingers, but the English mustard.  When it was being discussed on TV Nigella mentioned that is was suitable for anything crunchy, so tonight I switched in in a family favorite.

I also added a teaspoon of [Panch Puran](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Seasoned-Pioneers-Phoran-Indian-Spices/dp/B00BXC6PMQ?dchild=1&keywords=Panch+Puran&qid=1617131485&sr=8-15&linkCode=ll1&tag=hhkudac-21&linkId=83cdc06bd27d938910caabe02ee01f23&language=en_GB&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) whole spice mix which adds fun little nuggets to bite into.


## You will need

* A handful of sausages, cut into 1 inch pieces
* A handful of potatoes, cut into 1 inch cubes
* A large onion, cube into rough cube (1cm or so)
* 2 large garlic cloves (fine sliced)
* 2 inches of ginger, peeled and fine diced or grated
* A big chilli, finely diced
* A few blocks of cooked spinach, ideally defrosted (but if they're still frozen, see below)
* A couple of slugs of olive oil
* A teaspoon of whole spice mix
* 2 teaspoons of English Mustard


## Do

* Put the onions, garlic and ginger in a big frying pan with a couple of teaspoons of olive oil on a low heat
* Stick the potatoes and sausages in the airfrier on 180, they'll take about 25 minutes, keep shaking them
* Keep the onions moving so they go soft and transparent.  Add the chili and the spice mix and cook until they start to catch, then turn off the heat.
* If you've used frozen spinach, stick the cubes round the end, pop the lid on and leave it until the potatoes and sausages are good to go.
* Once the potatoes and the sausage are well cooked and crispy, take the lid off the onions, turn the heat on again, add the mustard and stir round.
* Add in the sausages and potatoes, stir round and give it a minute to come together.
