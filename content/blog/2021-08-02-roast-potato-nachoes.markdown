Our household loves roast potatoes done in the airfrier.  War lass loves nachos.  I am less keen on them.  Luckily it turns out that you can marry the two things and everybody loves them!


## You will need

* Enough potatoes for 2
* A couple of small onions if you want to do roasted onion topping
* A teaspoon of vegetable oil
* Whatever you like to top nachoes with.  In my case, peppers (grilled), avacado, natural yoghurt, cheese and lots of sliced spring onions

## Do

* Chop to potatoes so they're no bigger than the first joint of your thumb
* Half the onions, peel and cut though the middle so they're still anchors together but can open up
* Toss it all in a bowl with the oil
* Air fry at 200oC for about 20 minutes or until the potatoes are crisp (I had to take the onion out part way though so it didn't burn)
* Pile onto a plate and top as normal


## Results

Can't be eaten with your fingers, requires a fork.  Very satisfying.
