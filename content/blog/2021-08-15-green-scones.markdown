I love a freshly made scone.  I think savoury scones benefit from being made "short", eg. not using all butter, but baking block of margarine.  In The Cloake's Marvelous Book she uses half butter, half lard which works well too.  My recipe is much simpler, but the rise on the scones isn't as big.

At the moment I have loads of herbs going bonkers in the garden, so I put a tonne into scones, so many that they were almost green.  I used what I had, including herb flowers, including but not limited to thyme, oregano, parsley, chives and spring onion tops.  I left out the mint and fennel which I didn't think would mix.


## You will need

* 350g self-raising flour
* A couple of handfuls of herbs, snipped finely
* 100g of baking block of baking marg
* About 120g of milk, I added by eye so amount is an estimate
* A big pinch of salt

## Do

* Stick the oven on 180
* Put the salt, flour, herbs and fat into a mixing bowl and rub it al toghther until the fat is evenly distributed, almost to a breadcrumb texture.
* Add enough milk to bind to a dough.  Don't work mixture too much, just sort of push it together.
* Roughly flatten it out to about 2cm thick.  Cut though with a knife into even shapes
* It's probably good to brush the tops with milk at this point, I did not
* Bake for around 15 minutes or until the edges are golden
* Cool whilst you make mugs of tea
* Eat with salted butter


## Results

So fresh and so clean
