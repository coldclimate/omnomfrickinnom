All the best food is interactive, and some rare beef tacos with a sweet and spicy salsa are just the ticket on a Friday night after a long week.

## You will need

* Thin beef steak
* A pair of sweetcorn on the cob
* A good sized chunk of pineapple, or a few rings from a tin
* A chilli
* A handful of corriandor fine chopped
* Taco trimmings (sliced lettice, grated cheese, sour cream, an inappropriate number of hot sauces)
* Taco shells or (in my case some mini wraps)


## Do

* Pop the grill on as hot as possible
* Put the corn, pineapple and chilli under the grill under blackened
* Keep turning until everything is a bit charred on sides.  Remove stuff as it's ready (the chilli browns quickly)
* Fry the steak under as well done as you want it, wrap in clingfilm and set aside
* Slice the corn off the cob, chop the pineapple roughly and fine slice the chilli
* Mix corn, pineapple, chilli and corriandor 
* Slice the steak finely
* Heat the tacos, prepare all rest of the trimmings
* Assumble everything ready for eating.


## Result

The rare meat is melt in the mount.  The salsa is a great mix of sweet, hot, charred and chunky.  Piling food together and eating with your hands is the way to get close.
