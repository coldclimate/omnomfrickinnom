My garden is producting a tonne of mint and parsely this summer so everything at the moment is being made with as much of both as I can get away with.  Lamb chops (or in this case chump chops) are great on a BBQ where a reasonably hot and fast grilling gives you juicy tasty meat and the delicious burnt bits. 

## You will need

* A big handful of fresh mint (peppermint in my case)
* A couple of fat lamb chops
* 3 or 4 cloves of garlic
* A good slug of oil
* The juice of half a lemon
* A heafy pinch of rock salt


## Do

* Grind everything except the lamb together
* Smear the bright green paste over the lamb and leave for a few hours
* Grill until blackened on the outside, pink in the middle.
* The meat will benefit for resting for a few minutes

We served it with a big heap of fluffy couscous with tomatos, fine sliced onion and huge amounts of parsely

## Result

The lamb is sweet, some of the garic is sharp and fresh, some is burnt and carmelised.  The cooking flavour changes the mint.  A squeeze of fresh lemon and more fresh mint over it all at the end of it wouldn't have gone a miss.
