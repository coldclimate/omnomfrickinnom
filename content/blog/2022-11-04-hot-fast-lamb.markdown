In my opinion lamb should be cooked very hot and fast, or very slowly, and my preference is for hot, fast and hard, bloody in the middle and black on the outside.  Recently I've started boning out shoulders of lamb until I've a few pieces about 3cm think at most, which can then go into a red oven oven.

## You will need

* A shoulder of lamb, boned out, or other cut.
* Rice, cooked
* A big handful of mint, finely chopped
* A big handful of parsley, finely chopped
* A big handful of coriander, finely chopped
* A small handful of dried apricots, finely chopped
* Half a preserved lemon, finely chopped
* A handful of cashews
* A big ripe tomato, finely diced
* A good sprinkle of sea salt
* Things to go with it, I had Black Olive Tapenade, Rose Harissa and Urfa Chilli Paste


## Do

* Stick the oven on as hot as possible and pop a heavy based roasting tin in
* Give the lamb a good sprinkle of salt and set aside
* Put the cashew nuts in the oven until they're toasted then chop
* Once the oven is screamingly hot, pop the lamb in, it should sizzle as it hits the pan
* Mix the herbs, apricots, herbs, tomato, cashews, lemon and rice and set aside
* Give the lamb about 10 minutes, maybe 15.
* Pull the lamb out and finely slice.
* Pile rice and lamb onto hot plates and spoon accoutrements round the edge.


## Result

The corned beef should still be in lumps.  There should be bits where the rice has fried off.  Each fork full should be a mix of everything, including a little of the toppings.  
 
I've no photos of the process, but here's four times I've eaten it in the last six months, with a few variations.
