One of my favorite cookbooks at the moment (I collect them so we have a few) is [Perfect Plates in 5 Ingredients by John Whaite](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Perfect-Plates-Ingredients-John-Whaite/dp/0857833510/ref=as_li_ss_tl?crid=RHMO7MCXGYCJ&dchild=1&keywords=perfect+plates+in+5+ingredients&qid=1597255962&sprefix=perfect+plates+5+,aps,174&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=hhkudac-21&linkId=123e5edd3beee13d66d0e48a08afdff7&language=en_GB) and recently we ate the chickpeas cooked with chorizo and cider, a marvelously savoury dish.

This evening I remembered reading in one of The Two Fat Ladies cookbooks (and I can't find which one) mentioned cooking fish and pork products together, I think it might have been frying fish in lard.  Having got a great fish box delivered this week, I stuck the two ideas together.

## You will need

* 2 tins of chickpeas, drained.  I used one tin of regular chickpeas and one of Kala Chana, the smaller, darker, nuttier variety
* 200g of chorizo diced into 1cm cubes
* 2 pieces of chunky white fish (I think ours was cod)
* 100ml of stock (I used beef because it was on hand)
* 200ml of dry cider
* A big handful of fresh parsley


## Do

* Pop the chorizo in a pan with a lid on a high heat for a few minutes until it's a bit crispy and the oil has started to run
* Add the chickpeas and sizzle for a few minutes
* Add the stock and cider, bubble up for a few minutes
* Add the fish on the top and half the parsley, pop a lid on and turn the heat down to a gentle bubble
* Once the fish is cooked though (maybe 5 minutes) you're ready to go
* Top with the rest of the parsley


## Result

The fish has steamed nicely and comes away in big flakes.  The chickpeas have bite to them but are tender.  The sharpness of the cider is a great foil to the oil of the chorizo.  Deeply savoury, very satisfying.

A chunk of bread with salted butter would have been great to soak up some juices.
