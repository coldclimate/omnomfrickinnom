Roughly this time last year I made [5 ingrediant tomato meatballs]({{< ref "2018-12-02-roasted-meatballs.markdown" >}}) for the first time and it is excellent, we've had it numerous times.  Tonight I decided to enrich it a little with some leftover double cream and tweak the spice mix a bit.  It worked out well, hence, a new post.

## You will need

### The pasty

* 500g of mince beef
* A pack of tiny tomatoes
* A red pepper (chopped in 1 inch chunks)
* A teaspoon of black pepper corns
* A teaspoon of whole dried all spice
* A dried chilli
* A tablespoon of cream
* A good slug of olive oil
* A tablespoon of polenda
* Spagetti



## Do

* Pop the oven on 200
* Pop the tomatoes and pepper into the oven in a non-stick roasting tin.  They need 10 minutes so you have time to...
* Grind the allspice, blackpepper and chilli
* In a bowl mash the beef, spices, olive oil and polenta with your hands until it's a a smooth paste
* Into the tray add the beef in bals made from a heaped teaspoon each.
* Cook until the tomatoes and peppers are blackened and the meatballs look almost burnt
* Lift out all the vegetables, add the cream and blend roughly spooth (I used our stick blender)
* About this time I cooked the pasta
* Pour the sauce over the meatballs and return to the oven for about 5 minutes until the edes of the sauce are thickened (don't worry about the extra fat that seems to be swimming out)
* Stir the pasta together with the meatballs and sauce and let it sit for a minute or two. Remember to scrape off the stuck on burnt bits. (the best bits)

## Result

The sauce is sharp but sharp.  The small size of meatballs means that they're crunchy on the outside.  Resting it all together before serving gives the pasta a chance to soak up some of the sauce.
