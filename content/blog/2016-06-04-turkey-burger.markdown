Turkey mince makes a great burger but because it's so low fat it's difficult to keep them together in the pan.  Step forward baking.  Because all the juice is kept in they're juicy.  It's quite a bland met so lots of thyme and zest helps.

## You will need

* Enough turkey mince (thigh ideally) to fill the ramekins
* Zest of 2 or more limes
* A few good sprigs of thyme, finely chopped
* Lots of black pepper
* A good splash of soy

## Do

1. Kneed it all together
2. Press into the ramekins
3. Bake at 180 until golden on the top


## Result
They shink away from the ramekin sides, so just lift them out with a fork and whack them into breadbuns.
