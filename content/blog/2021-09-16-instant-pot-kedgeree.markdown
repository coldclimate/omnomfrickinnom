I love kedgeree, and it turns out you can make it in an InstantPot.


## You will need

* 1 cup of rice (yes, yes, American measures, but rice is best cooked by volume)
* Just short of two cups of water
* 2 pieces of smoked fish (I used two pieces of smoked coley)
* 3 eggs
* 3 fat spring onions, finely sliced
* A cardamom pod
* A heaped teaspoon of hot curry powder
* Half a teaspoon of garam masala
* A small handful of parsley, finely chopped
* 2x knobs of butter

## Do

* Saute the onions in the butter until soft
* Add the rice, cardamom, curry powder and stir
* Add the water and then prop the InstantPot Trivet in
* Balance the fish and eggs on the trivet
* Cook on rice mode, which is 12 minutes
* Let the steam out
* Fluff the rice, peel then chop the eggs and fish and mix
* Stir though the parsley, garam masala and second bit of butter


## Results

Savoury, lightly spiced, very satisfying.
