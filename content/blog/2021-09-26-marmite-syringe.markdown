These days I love Marmite.  Once upon a time I could not stand it.  Previous me was a jerk at times.
We tend to buy Marmite in the 1kg tubs, because it's so much cheaper, but the nature of the sticky black goo makes it difficult to keep the tubs clean, which is frustrating.  It's also very easy to scoop out more and more Marmite over time, leaving to me eating far more than I probably should (especially as it can be a gout trigger for some).

Thus I set out to solve those two problems at the same time.


## You will need

* A massive medical or food grade syringe, like one big enough for a horse
* Marmite
* A flexible spatula will be handy

## Do

* Stand your tub of Marmite in a bowl of hot water to help it soften and flow more easily.  It'll probably take a good five minutes
* Wash and clean the syringe.
* Stop the end of the syringe.  I used a bit of clingfilm, BlueTac would have been ideal
* Stand the syringe vertically without the plunger in.  I popped it in a jug.
* Carefully pour the Marmite into the barrel of the syringe, taking care not to get any on the outside.  I didn't have a huge amount in the current jar, hence the slightly odd looking result.
* The hard bit is putting the plunger back into the syringe, because there's an air bubble under the plunger you don't want , but you can't press it out because you'll just squeeze the Marmite out.  I inserted the plunger a little, then tilted the whole thing on it's side and let the Marmite level out, then tilted it nozzle to the top and once the Marmite had settled squeezed out the air.  It went ok, next time I'll probably skip the horizontal step.
* I ended up trimming the nozzle so that it was a little wider and meant I could squeeze it out a little faster.

## Results

Very clean, takes up far too much room in the cupboard, my girlfriend dislikes it and people think I'm an idiot, but...I love to.  I had squeeze out a good amount reasonably quickly, distribute it across the toast more evenly so it spreads more easily and even the barrel behind the plunger is clean.
