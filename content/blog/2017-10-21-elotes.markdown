At an amazing hole in the wall place in Key West we ate corn on the cob that came wrapped in foil.  I'd no idea what it was called, but a bit of googling uncovered "elotes".  Meantime I'd had a go to recreate it and it turned out I wasn't a million miles away.  The real thing has mayonise and sour cream however.

## You will need

* Fresh corn
* Grazed parmesan 
* A good pinch of ground chilli
* A good pinch of smoked paprika
* A lime
* Ground black pepper
* Butter


## Do

1. Boil the corn
2. Mix all the dry ingrediants and sprinkle evenly on plate
3. Rub the corn with butter and then roll in the dry ingrediants
4. Squeeze some lime over it



## Result

Super savour, super morish.  Next time I'm going to give the corn a blast with the blowtorch before I butter it
