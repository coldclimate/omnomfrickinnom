I've never been nervous about posting a recipe before, but since a friend linked me to [this famous take down of Jamie Olivers fried rice][https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53me-ICi_f8] I did consider it twice.

Fried rice scouse-ups, much like soupy beans, are my go to comfort food.  They're a great way to use up stuff and on a cold night or after a very long day.

This makes enough for two people to feel slightly too full.

## You will need

* A reasonable sized onion, diced into mixed size pieces
* 1 clove of garlic finely sliced
* A couple of spring onions, finely sliced, white and greens
* 1 egg, maybe 2
* Enough rice for two people.  Ideally cold from the day before, broken up with a fork [notes on reheating rice](https://www.nhs.uk/common-health-questions/food-and-diet/can-reheating-rice-cause-food-poisoning/)
* Frozen peas, roughly 1/4 of the volume of rice
* Frozen sweetcorn, roughly the same amount
* Half a tin of corned beef, chopped into 1cm chunks
* Sunflower oil
* Your choice of toppings
* * Hoisin
* * Chilli flakes maybe [lao gan ma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lao_Gan_Ma)?
* * Soy
* * Toasted sesame oil


## Do

* In a big frying pan or wok, heat a couple of teaspoons of oil
* Fry the onion and garlic until the smaller bits of onion are crispy and the bigger bits properly softened
* Add the peas and sweetcorn.  If you're using frozen there's no need to defrost them, just throw them in
* Keep it all moving for a few minutes and then add the rice
* Keep stirring it so the rice doesn't catch
* Add the cornbeef and cook for another minute or two
* Push all the rice to one side, add a little more oil to the other side and when it's hot crack the eggs in
* Move the eggs about a bit until some has set (like scrambled eggs) then push the rice over the eggs and stir around.  You're aiming to distribute the egg though the rice and make sure it cooks out
* Tip the spring onions in, and cook it all for another minute or so
* Once you're ready to serve, pile it into hot bowls and add your toppings of choice.

## Result

The corned beef should still be in lumps.  There should be bits where the rice has fried off.  Each fork full should be a mix of everything, including a little of the toppings.  
 
I've no photos of the process, but here's four times I've eaten it in the last six months, with a few variations.
