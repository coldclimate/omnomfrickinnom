An old favouite with a few new things.  Black pudding and roasted onion add more variety and the beer in the batter gives a great crispy finish.  Thank to [Felicity Cloake's How to cook the perfect toad in the hole](2016-08-08-miso-poached-teriyaki-chicken.markdown) for suggesting that.

## You will need

* Quality sausages
* About half the amount of black pudding
* A red onion
* A slug of vegetable oil
* 70ml of ale
* 70ml of milk
* 100g of self rasing flour
* A good pinch of mustard powder
* Salt and pepper
* 2 eggs

## Do

1. Stick the oven on about 180
2. Pop the sausages and black pudding into a metal tray and stick in the oven
3. Whisk the eggs, milk and beer in a bowl
4. Whisk in the flour, salt and pepper.  Set aside
5. After about 10 minutes add the red onion cut into eighths and return to the oven
6. After about another 10 minutes the sausages should be browned, the onions softened and the black pudding cooked
7. Cut the sausage and black pudding into lengths about 3cm long.  Turn the oven up to 220
8. Stik the hot metal tray on the cooker top, add a slug of vegetable oil to the sausage fat,  retun all the sausage and black pudding to the try
9. Whack the heat up so the oil is sizzling and pout over the batter
10. Return to the oven for another ten minutes or so or until everything is puffed up and brown on the top
11. Server with more mustard (I went for the trio of englih, djon and wholegrain) and gravy (I cheated and used a pot)


## Result

Crunchy bits, soft wobbily bits, meaty bits, the onion is sweet, the black pudding extra savoury.
