There are few things as American as hot wings in my eyes, and I bloody love them.  They're great vechicals for hot sauce too, which is handy because eating it with a spoon is generally frowned up.  Normally hotwings are deep fried and then drenched in a mix of melted butter mixed with hot sauce.  Excellent for the face, terrible on the waistline.  I'd read a few posts about how to get really crispy wings when baking using baking power so I thought I'd give it a go.

Chicken wings seem difficult to buy on their own with good ethical sources.  Looking at the high welfare chickens in the supermarket you can get all the usual broken down pieces, thighs, breasts, drumsticks etc, but not wings. Very odd.  

## You will need

* A pack of chicken wings
* A heaped teaspoon of baking powder
* A heaped teaspoon of rough salt
* A couple of tablespoons of hot sauce.  I used Franks, a classic wing sauce

## Do

0. Stick the oven on 200
1. Shake wings, salt an baking powder
2. Arrange on a metal tray in a single layer and bake until crisp, about 20 minutes (see picture) 
3. Pour over red sauce and stir to cover all chicken
4. Bake again for 10 mins until the edges are burnt

## Result

Crunchy bits, soft bits, gooy bits, slick bits.  Hot enough to be properly hot, but not greasy.  A good vinegar based hot sauce is the key.  We had classic sides of mac'n'cheese and a sharp coleslaw.
