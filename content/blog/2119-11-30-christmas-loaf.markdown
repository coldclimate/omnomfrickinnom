This is an enriched bread dough, with a bunch of seasonal fruit, a dose of spice and some light brown sugar.  I threw in a tangarine too, which lead to too much moisture and to load sinking in the middle, but it tasted great.

I love my breadmaker.  It's not available any more, but the closest model is the [Panasonic SD-2500](https://amzn.to/35OhuW).  The timer is invaluble and intuative, very handy for having fresh bread in the morning.

## You will need

* 200g wholemeal bread flour
* 200g white bread flour
* A heaped teaspoon of mixed spice
* A small handful of raisons
* A small handful of currents
* A small handful of mixed peel
* A small handful of light brown sugar
* An egg
* A packet of fresh yeast
* Optional: some season fruit - such as a tangarine
* 270ml water


## Do

* Put it all in the breadmaker

## Result

A little richer than normal, smells amazing, tremendous fresh with butter, great toasted.  Sort of likea giant hotcross bun.
