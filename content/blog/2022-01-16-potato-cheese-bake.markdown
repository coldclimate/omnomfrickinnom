Tonight's tea needed to be quick, easy, hands off comfort food and to use up some of the huge chunk of raclette cheese we bought this weekend.  We also had ends of cheese to use up after Christmas that had gone had hard, so they went in too.


## You will need

* Enough potatoes to cover the bottom of an ovenable dish with a lid, thinly sliced, I did mine on the mandolin
* A leek, finely slices
* About 150g of cheese, cut into 1cm cubes.  I used a mix of strong cheddar (very dry), red leicester (drier) and some fresh melty raclette
* A fat clove of garlic minced
* Enough milk to cover the potatoes
* Salt and pepper


## Do

* Pile it all in, other than the melty cheese and the milk.  Make sure the salt and pepper are well distributed
* Pour the milk in
* Pop the lid on and bake in the over at 160 for an hour (make sure it doesn't go dry - add a bit more milk if needed)
* Take the lid off and bake until it's crispy on the top
* Serve


## Results

Crispy bits, soft bits, leeky bits, a lot of cheese.  A handyful of diced smoky bacon in there would not have gone a miss, but GOUT SAYS NO.
