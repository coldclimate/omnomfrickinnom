This week I ran across okonomiyaki on twitter (mostly because I jokes about the potential farts from a cabbage and egg based meal), but we had a big green cabbage to use up, so I figured I'd have a go.   I read a few recipes online and several were topped with fine sliced belly pork (which I didn't have) but I did have some excellent unsmoked bacon.  I also didn't have several of the other common ingredients, so much so that I really should be ashamed to call this okonomiyaki really.

Whilst prepping everything I added some fine sliced leek top that would have otherwise gone off, resulting in the distinctly Welsh finish.


## You will need

* 3/4 cup of self-raising flour
* 1 tsp salt
* 2 eggs
* 1 heaped teaspoon of miso paste
* 1/2 cup of water
* 3 big rashers of streaked unsmoked bacon
* 2 big handfuls of fine sliced green cabbage
* 1/2 handful of fine slices leek top
* A couple of spoons of fat to cook in, I used some bacon fat


## Do

* Whisk all the ingredients other than the cabbage, leek and bacon into a thick batter
* Put a big non-stick pan with a lid on a medium heat and stick the fat in
* Mix the leek, cabbage and batter until it's a big wet handful
* Lay the bacon in the pan close together to build a bacon mat
* Plop all the cabbage mix on the top and press down 
* Put the lid on and cook for a good 5 minutes, maybe 10.
* Carefully flip it over
* Cook under a lid for another 5 minutes or so until it's cooked though
* Take the lid off, flip it bacon side down and cook on a high heat for 2 minutes. 


## Result

I served this with an attempt at okonomiyaki sauce (ketchup, oyster sauce, soy, sugar, cooked together), sprinkles (Shichi-mi t≈çgarashi), Lao Gan Ma chilli flakes in oil and steamed rice.
