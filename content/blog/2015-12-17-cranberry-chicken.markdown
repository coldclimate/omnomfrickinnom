A good way to use up Christmas trimmings or, in my case, christmas party leftovers and bargins to be had hen shopping.


## You will need

* Chicken portions, I used drumsticks
* A handful of fresh cranberries
* 3 peppers
* A large glass of wine or beer
* One of these [handy stock pots](http://amzn.to/1QCCVNF) or some leftover gravy
* A couple of spoonfuls of cranberry sauce
* A chilli

Little bit of garlic and lemon would not go amiss.

## Do

1. Brown the chicken in a pan you can put in the oven
2. Add the peppers (diced), cranberries, chilli and wine/beer
3. Bang it in a 180 oven for a good 40 minutes
4. Add the gravy/stock and cranberry sauce, give it all a good stir
5. return to the oven for another 30 mins or so
6. Take the lid off and let the top almost burn


## Results

Sweet and sticky, just enough heat from a single chilli, a touch oily.  Some lemon at the end would have heped cut the grease. Rice was good but toast would have been better.  I'd e tempted to add some pigs in blankets on top next time.
