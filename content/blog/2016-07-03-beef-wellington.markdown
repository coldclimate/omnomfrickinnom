Beef wellington is one of those things which looks amazing, combines some expensive ingrediants but it surprisingly easy.  The trick to it is manage to cook the pastry whilst keep keeping the beef rare.  

## You will need

* A piece of beef fillet, ideally a slice about two inches thick
* A back of puff pasty
* Half an onion
* A handful of mushrooms
* A sprig of thyme
* About 75ml of dry sherry
* Butter
* Djion mustard
* Splash of milk
* Tiny touch of oil



## Do

1. Dry the beef and season well
2. Sear in a very hot pan on sides with a drop of oil.  The aim here is as fast and hard as possible.
3. Rest on a cold plate whilst you do the rest
4. Stick the oven on 220oC so it's hot when you need it
5. Fine dish the onion and mushroom
6. Soften th onion with a blob of butter
7. After a few minutes, add the mushrooms and the thyme (on or off the twig)
8. Once the mushroom has started to colour add the sherry and turn the heat up
9. Bubble until all the liquidd is evaporated and then put off to one side
10. Spread mustard on the top of the streak (which shoud be cool to the touch) 
11. Pop the mushroom mix on the pastry then the streak on top
12. Wrap neatly (clingfilm aparenty helps here)
13. Pop on a baking tray, joins down
14. Brush with milk
15. Bake for about 15 minutes
16. Stuff in your face!


## Result

Crisp outside, tender inside, meat juices boil out and turn the pastry on the bottom into a slightly sticky savoury stuck on bit.

Next time I'd stick it on a sheet of baking paper because the stuck on bits were delicious, but annoying.
