I'm just back from driving round [The North Coat 500](https://www.northcoast500.com) whih was tremendous fun.  Knowing I was camping for a few days I wanted to take some food with me but everything I read in "quick ccampfire meal" type blog posts involved boiling huge amounts of water.  It's tough to heat water because of it's high specific heat capacity and I only have a tiny stove so I wanted to find things I could prepare in advance which didn't involve boiling the ocean.

## You will need

* A handful of lamb, diced
* A handful of olives
* A handful of dried apricots, roughly chopped
* A heaped teaspoon of Moroccan spice mix
* Two handfuls of couscous
* Half a stock pot thingy

## Do

1. Brown the lamb until it's well browned and cooked through
2. Add spices and sizzle for a moment, then turn the heat off
3. Mix in the olives, apricots and couscous, stir in and lift off any stuck on bits from the pan
4. Bag it with the stock pot and freeze once cold
5. To cook, stick in the stove pot and add a cup full water. Stir.
6. Once steam is rising pop a lid on and stir every few minutes until lamb is hot and couscous has fluffed out.
7. Watch out for burning.



## Result
Spicy, warming, the oil of the olives and the lamb is not greasy surprisingly.
