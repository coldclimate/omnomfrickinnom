Many years ago, whilst watching Buffy, Spike (the best Buffy character) mentioned Blooming Onions.  The idea piqued my interest, and then I forgot about it.  Many years later my old friend James tweeted me a link about them seeing if I fancied making them, and I did, but... I forgot again.  A few months later my friend John sent me a tweet linking to them, James piled in and so we decided to get together and make them.

Whilst we had 15 litres of hot oil we fried up a whole jointed chicken.

## You will need

* A big onion, as big as you can get
* An egg
* A mug of milk
* Plain flour - about a cup full
* Salt - couple of teaspoonfuls
* Paprika - couple of teaspoonfuls
* Ground coriander - couple of teaspoonfuls
* 15 litres of sunflower or peanut oil
* A deep fat frier


## Do

We tried egg washing and flouring but it didn't really stick, so we whisked up a batter and that worked better

* Put the deep fat frier on
* Whisk up everything except the onion
* Trim the top inch off the onion and then remove a core about an inch wide
* Cut vertically though the onion (not all the way) 8 or 12 times, evenly spaced
* Gently tease the "petals" open (this and the step before it are much harder than they sound)
* Dip in the batter and try to get it evenly stick to the onion
* Deep fry for about 10 mminutes

## Result

Crispy crunchy delicious bits, soft sweat inside bits, kinda like an onion bhaji but not doughly at all.  A tremendous faff but well worth it.  Buffy gif suggests we should have stuck them in ice water so they open up and maybe we will next time.
