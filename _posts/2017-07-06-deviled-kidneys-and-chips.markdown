Every so often my [G&S Organics](http://www.thechristmasfarm.co.uk/) meatbox comes with a secret message on the top - CC.  It's my twitter handle, but it's also a goodd sign that Lee has popped me something exta in, knowing we're not a household which only eats steak.  This mornings box carried justsuch a label and inside... lamb kidneys and a heart!  I've been [promising myself that I will eat more offal](http://amzn.to/2uPt4hs) recently, great timing.

I considered steak and kidney pie, but its best with a long slow cook.  Devilled kidneys on the other hand are super fast, though the counjour up images of silver salvers and Victorian breakfasts for me.  This was however to be for my tea, so it was time to support another local business who do somethign better than I can, [Southend Plaice](https://www.facebook.com/Southend-Plaice-468051706696412/), my local (excellent) chippy.

## You will need


* A pair of fresh lambs kidneys
* A tablespoon of plain flour
* A teaspoon of chilli powder
* A teaspoon of english mustard
* A teaspoon of ground black pepper
* A tablespoon of butter
* Chips

## Do

1. Slice the kidney along their length and snip out the hard white core with scissors
2. Pat dry
3. Mix all the dry ingrediants in a plastic bag
4. op the kidneys in the bag and shack vigerously
5. Melt the butter in a pan and turn the heat up
6. Sizzle the kidneys on a medium heat for a couple of minutes either side 
7. Pile kidneys onto chips (points for figuring out where I popped out to buy chips)


## Result

Key cut side of the kidney has a good crisp to it, the inside is soft.  The spice and bite of the devilling works well with the salt and vinegar on the chips.
