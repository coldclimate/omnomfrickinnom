I love mackerel pate.  It's super quick to make, deeply savoury and satifying.  If the mackrel, lemon and cremefresh are all fridge cold you can serve it straight away.

## You will need

* A whole lemon
* A pack of cooked smoked mackerel
* Creme Fresh (I used half fat)
* Black pepper
* A small bunch of parsley (flat leaf)


## Do

1. Strip the skin off the fish
2. Mash with a fork, watching out for any bones that have sneaked though
3. Add the zest and juice of the lemon
4. Add enough black pepper to kill a mouse
5. Add the parsley finely snipped
6. Add enough cremefresh to bind it to you prefered consistency.  This was about 4 heaped desert spoonfuls for me
7. Mash it all together with the fork
8. Smear on crackers/toast/toasted English mufins

It's best when it's a served cold, atop something warm.

## Result

Fishy, smokey, savoury, sharp, peppery, creamy, delicious.
