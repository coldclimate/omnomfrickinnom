Years ago I baked chicken pieces in cream, tarragon and carmelised onions for a dinner party. It was excellent, but very rich.  This is a lighter alternative, perfect for a summer evening tea.

## You will need

* Chicken thighs.  2 per person
* A tub of low fat greek yoghurt
* A large bunch of tarragon
* A bag of peppery salad.  Finally a use for rocket!
* A squeeze of lemon


## Do

1. Stick the chicken in a metal backing tray and into an oven at 180o
2. Bake until just done.
3. Stick bunches of tarragon under each piece of chicken and top with a good blob of Greek yoghurt.  Spread it out more than I did and a scrape of black pepper.
4. Bake for another ten minutes. There should be plenty of juices.
5. Leave to cool for five minutes
6. Whisk all the juices with a couple of heaped tablespoons of yoghurt and a squeeze of lemon.  Here I made a mistake and should have stripped the eaves from the cooked tarragon
7. Pile salad onto a plate, top with chicken and pour over the sauce.  Note I should really not have added the tarragon stems. 
8. Serve immediately, warm things on top of salad wait for no man.


## Results

Creamy wihtout being too heavy.  Lemon offsets the grease of the chicken (no extra fat was added).  I left the bone in the chicken which might have been a mistake for ease of eating.
