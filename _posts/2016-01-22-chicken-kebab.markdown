Kebabs have a bad name in the UK and looking at the pavement detritus on a Sunday morning, I'd agree. However a good kebab is a think of wonder, and one of the things which makes it great is a good bread rather than a poor pita.  I buy my breads from an Asian supermarket on my way home, still warm, because I couldn't make one as good. I used a ridged cast iron pan because I could get it hot and then put it under the grill, cooking the chicken quickly so that it stayed juicy.

## You will need


* A large chicken breast per person
* [Tandoori spice mix](http://amzn.to/1QCCeUi)
* Lemon Juice
* Greek yogurt
* [Cumin seeds](http://amzn.to/1JTWJN1)
* A cucumber
* Fresh corridor
* Hot sauce
* A flat bread/naan/roti


## Do

1. Chop the chicken into large chunks and dump in a plastic bag with a heaped tablespoon of tandoori spices and a healthy lemon juice.  Shake until everything is mixed and stick it in the fridge over night.
2. On the night...
3. Put a heaped teaspoon of cumin seeds into a fry pan and heat until they pop and sizzle.
4. Grind them in a pestle
5. Fine slice a few inches of cucumber and mix with cumin and enough yogurt to bind.  Refrigerate.
6. Stick the grill on high and pop a ridged cast iron pan onto a high heat.
7. Once everything is hot dump the chicken in and after a few minutes turn each piece so they've all got griddle marks on the outside.
8. Pop the pan under the grill.  It should only take a few minutes until everything is cooked though.
9. Mix and eat

## Results

So good I eat it sober. Lots.
