This was a quick dish that I could stick on to cook whilst I did a million and one things one evening.  It's a bastardization of flavours and cuisines, but it's tasty in your face. 


## You will need

* Stewing beef.  I had 250g
* Heaped teaspoon of lazy ginger
* Level teaspoon of lazy garlic
* Juice of half a fat lemon
* Heaped teaspoon of tomato puree
* Half a mug of water
* teaspoon of oil
* Slug of soy
* Slug of fish sauce
* A couple of hot chillis (I used some dried birdeye I had)

## Do

This produces shredded beef which you can then do things with.  I just stuffed mine into a pita bread with salad and a smear of sharp yogurt.

1. Sizzle the garlic and ginger with the oil in a pan for a minute
2. Whack the beef in and give it all a good stir. Sizzle on a reasonabele heat for a few minutes
3. Add the rest of the ingrediants, bring to the boil
4. Reduce the heat so the liquid is just bubbling, pop a lid on and leave for half an hour stirring occasionally
5. Turn off the heat an leave to sit for 20 minutes (the beef is much tenderer because of this)
6. Chop or shred the meat and do something with it


## Results

Sharp, pungent, powerful and tremendous in things.  You'd not want a whole plate of this but as a filling it's great.
