A rare vegetarian meal, but one I love hot or cold.


## You will need

* 500g of fresh spinach (I actually used a mi of fresh which needed using up and frozen to make it up)
* an egg
* 300ml milk
* 200g of red lentils
* a small onion
* two slices of bread
* a inch of strong cheese
* a heaped tablespoon of premade horseradish 
* a heaped tablespoon of tomato ketchup
* Butter for greasing



## Do

1. Fine dice the onion
2. Boil lentils and onion in boiling water until lentils are tender.  Drain hard
3. Mash lentil mix with horseradish and ketchup until a chunky paste. Set aside
4. Cook lentil in a pan with no extra water until tender.
5. Drain, squeeze dry and chop roughly
6. Separate out the egg yolk and mix briskly with milk into the spinach and a blob of butter
7. Whisk the egg white to stiff peaks and fold into spinach carefully
8. Pour spinach onto grease proof paper lined swiss roll tin (I had to use tinfoil today)
9. Bake for 20 minutes at 180oC until risen and firm
10. Remove spinach from the oven and allow to cool until you can handle it
11. Smooth the lentil mix over the spinach in a single layer (about equal depth to the spinach)
12. Roll carefully separating the greaseproof paper off the back of the spinach as you go
13. Blitz the bread and cheese to a fine crumb
14. Bake for 15 minutes until the coating is crunchy
15. Cut slices an inch or so wide, either hot or cold, I love it.
