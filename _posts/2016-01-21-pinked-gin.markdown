I love a gin martini and I love sloe gin (of which I have an excess), but sometimes sloe gin needs that extra kick of strong alcohol.  Step forth The Pinked Gin

## You will need

All should be very very cold

* Gin.  I used an export strength Plymouth
* Sloe Gin
* A lemon


## Do

1. Pour sloe gin into a very cold glass
2. Zest a couple of good scrapes of lemon into the glass.  Catch the oil that sprays
3. Carefully float an equal amount of cold gin on top of the sloe gin.

## Results

Zestier, punchier and more elegant than just sloe gin.
