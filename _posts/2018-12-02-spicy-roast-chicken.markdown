Marinading chicken pieces and baking them in the oven is super simple and delicious.  I always seem to have lots of yoghurt marinade left and there's nothing you can do with it because it's full of raw chicken.  I hate waste, so I thought I'd try double dipping, recoating the pieces of chicken half way through cooking.  The result was a really thick and spicy finish.

The whole spices in the marinade are mostly not there not for the flavour they impart in the maridaning process but as delicious spicy explosions when you crunch through them.

## You will need

* About a cup full of yoghurt
* Two heaped teaspoons of minced garlic 
* Two heaped teaspoons of minced ginger (I used the stuff from a jar)
* Two heaped teaspoons of hot curry powder
* A heaped teaspoon of [Mr Vikki's King Naga](https://amzn.to/2KOhnkt) pickle
* A heaped teaspoon of whole spice mix (I used [Panch Puran](https://amzn.to/2Pc1pkx) )
* A kilo of chicken pieces (skin on)
* Zest and juice of a lemon

## Do

* Mix everything
* Refrigerate for a few hours
* Stick the over on 180
* Lay the chicken pieces out in the single layer and stuck in the oven, reserving all the marinade that doesn't stick to the chicken
* After 20 minutes take the tray out of the oven and dump all the pieces into the reserved marinade
* Stir it all together and then dump the whole lot back into the tray
* Turn the oven up to 200 and return the chicken to it
* After about 10 minutes you should be good to go
* Serve with some well dressed salad and breads

## Result

The chicken is cooked though after the first 20 minutes, the extra sauce and increased oven temperature gives you extra crunchy gooey bits.  The whole spice pop when you eat them.  The Naga pickle is crazy hot but also sweet.
