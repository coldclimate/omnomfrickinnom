Another chunk of lamb, spiced, blackened and then left to rest.  This was a leg of lamb I boned out and flattened.  The grape chutney was a use up of some past their best grapes, I've been rather facinated with "fresh pickles" of ate.  They don't keep, but they are delicious. 

## You will need

### For lamb
 * A small leg of lamb
* A heaped tablespoon of Morrocan spice mix (I had some Schwartz in that was heavy on cumin and coriander)
* A heaped teaspoon of hot chili powder
* Sunflower oil

### For the grape chutney

* A handful red grapes
* Juice of half a lemon
* A slug of beer or other liquid (the beer was in my hand as I was cooking)



## Do

1. Bone out the lamb and try and get it as flat as possible
2. Slash deeply into the meat on both sides
3. Mix the ground spiced with a teaspoon of oil to get a thick paste, only just wet enough to hold together
4. Rub the mix into the lamb and really work it in. I wrapped my hands in clingfilm to avoid the chili
5. Wrap the lamb in a plastic bag and stick it in the fridge. I weighted it down with jars. Leave a few hours
6. Fire up your BBQ
7. Grill lamb for about 10 minutes, turning regularly until blackened on both sides.
8. I put the lid on for about 15 mins with the lamb not directly over the coals.
9. Lift off and wrap tightly in clingfilm.  Rest for about 10 minutes whilst making the grapes
10. Stick grapes, juice of half a lemon and a slug of beer into a pan
11. Bring to the boil
12. Pop the grapes
13. Simmer until the consistency of runny jam
14. Unwrap the lamb and slice reasonably thinly

I served it with couscous, a blob of homemade lemon pickle (year old, needed using, very like lime pickle) and some grilled chorizo (meat as a side dish)

## Results

The lamb was charred on the outside, pink in the middle, with a realy good heat to the crust.  Thanks to resting it was very juicy.  The sweetness of the grape chutney is not unakin to having redcurrent with lamb but much sweeter and sharper.  Grilled chorizo is gilding a lily really but excellent.
