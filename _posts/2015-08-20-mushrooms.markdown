Mushrooms are one of my favorite foods but I get to eat them infrequently because they're very much a marmite food and our house is 50/50 split, so when I get the chance I binge.  I imagine peoples dislike of them is related to their potential for wet dog smell however this combination of frying under a lid seems to avoid this.

## You will need

* Good bread for toast.  It doens't need to be anything special but something with seeds and grains is good.
* Mushrooms
* 2 good blobs of butter
* A small bunch of parsley
* A few good scrapes of lemon zest
* About a teaspoon of lemon juice
* Salt and pepper


## Do

1. Stick the bread on to toast.  I like it to have gone cold before it receives it's topping
2. Peel and slice the mushrooms about as thick as a pound coin
3. Pile mushrooms into a cold frying pan, add a blob of butter on the top, turn on a low heat and cover
4. Give the mushrooms about 5 minutes by which point they will have leached a lot of liquid and the butter will have melted. Stir, turn u the heat a little and uncover.
5. Once you reach the point of the last of the liquid almost boiling away add the zest and give it a stir.
6. Once the liquid has boiled off you're left with mushrooms starting to fry properly in the butter.  Give it a minute of so and then dump in the parsley and a small blob more butter.
7. Stir it all round, add the lemon juice and then pile onto toast along with a good twist of black pepper and some flaky salt.


## Results

The mushrooms are cooked but still with plenty of bite, velvety against the crisp toast.  The richness of the butter (and there should be enough to make it like eating a slice of buttered toast) is lifted and de-greased by the lemon juice.  The zest and parsley add a great smell.
