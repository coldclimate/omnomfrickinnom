It's something of a tradition in my house to make sandwiches on Xmas night using the leftovers, but there is a rule: if it was on the table, it's in the sandwich.  Additions are allowed, but no skipping things, even sprouts.

Due to the volume and weight involved it's something of a construction challenge so I include notes and photos.


## You will need

* Bread
* Everything that was on the table, no cheating.


## Do

1. Toast base layer for structural integrity.  Cranberry sauce (not too liquid). ![Toast base](/images/christmas-sandwich/christmas-sandwich-10.jpg)
2. White turkey meat.  Always a bit dry so close to the cranberry.  ![Turkey meat](/images/christmas-sandwich/christmas-sandwich-9.jpg)
3. Sliced roast potatoes and parsnips. ![Roast vegetable layer](/images/christmas-sandwich/christmas-sandwich-8.jpg)
4. Sliced sprout and carrots.  ![Boiled vegetable layer](/images/christmas-sandwich/christmas-sandwich-7.jpg)
5. Instead of heaping up, start on the other slice.  Bread this time spread with bread sauce natch ![Bread on bread](/images/christmas-sandwich/christmas-sandwich-6.jpg)
6. More meat.  Sliced sausages in blankets and stuffing ![Roasted meat layer](/images/christmas-sandwich/christmas-sandwich-5.jpg)
7. Baked red cabbage for moisture ![Non traditional, but excellent](/images/christmas-sandwich/christmas-sandwich-4.jpg)
8. Cold gravy and black pepper. ![Cold gravy is deliciouss](/images/christmas-sandwich/christmas-sandwich-3.jpg)
9. Construct with a quick flip and cross cut![Distinct layers are importantt](/images/christmas-sandwich/christmas-sandwich-2.jpg)
