I stumbled across an excellent [slow cooker pulled brisket](https://smittenkitchen.com/2010/01/southwestern-pulled-brisket/) this week and had cravings.  I also had a small leg of lamb in the freezer which needed using.  Swapping beef for lamb, turns out to work well.

## You will need

* A chunk of lamb (mine was about 1.2kg with bone)
* A heaped teaspoon each of ground cumin, black pepper, ground coriander and chilli powder
* An onion, grated
* A smoked chilli, fine chopped
* A couple of cloves of garlic grated
* A couple of teaspoons of tomato puree
* about 125ml of cider vinegar
* About the same of hot water
* a couple of bayleafs



## Do

1. Mix everything
2. Slow cook for about 6 hours (cut the meat off the bone if it's stcicking up out of the sauce)
3. Pour sauce off into something and leave to cool so you can skim the fat off
4. Once you're ready to eat, shred the meat
5. Boil the sauce to reduce it to the consistency of... I'm stuck here...custard?
6. Mix meat and sauce
7. Serve


## Result

We topped toasted tortila with heads of meat, blackbeans and quickly red onion.
