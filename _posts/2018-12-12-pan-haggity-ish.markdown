It's that time of the year (that most wonderful time of the year) where you can completely justify eating comforting food. 

YES - I said it again - the weather is rubbish, everything seems to be terrible and it's totally justified to eat pork, carbs and cheese baked in meaty salty delicious stock.

You'll need you a frying pan that can go in the oven.

## You will need

* Enough potatoes to fill your frying pan, finely sliced (I used a mandolin)
* About 4 slices bacon, diced
* a small onion, sliced
* A chicken stock pot, disolved in half a pint of water
* Hard italian cheese, grated roughly, about a big handful
* Butter, four slices


## Do

* Stuck the oven on 180
* Put the bacon and onion in the frying pan with a touch of butter on a medium heat
* (Now is a good time to slice the potatoes)
* Once the bacon is cooked and the onion is softened tip it out to a bowl
* Return the pan to the heat, add a touch more butter and start laying the potatoes, try a nice pattern
* Build a couple of layers, then scatter over a handful of onion and bacon
* Repeat until you've basically filled the pan.  It took 3 layers for me
* Let it cook for a few minutes so that the bottom layer fries
* Pour over the stock and turn up the heat
* Once the stock is boiling turn off the heat
* Pour over the stock
* Scatter the cheese on the top
* Add the butter to the top
* Stick it in the oven for about 20 minutes until everything is crisp and most of the liquid has boiled away
* Serve

## Result

Super savoury, just a bit too salty, great combination of textures.  My second helping came with sauerkraut and spicy chutney.
