I hate letting things go to waste, and so discovering a bruised and over ripe mango plus a few past their best chillis in the veg rack was a little upsetting, however it was an excuse to make some mango pickle.  It's a fresh pickle so won't keep long, but is super tasty.


## You will need

* One large mango
* A couple of chillis
* A cup of cider vinegar
* Half a thumb of ginger
* Coriander seeds
* A clove of garlic


## Do

1. Skin the mango, chop up flesh roughly and discard anything too past
2. Fine chop the garlic, ginger and chillis
3. Bring the vinegar to the boil and dump in all the ingredients.
4. Pop a lid on it and reduce to a gentle simmer for 5 minutes.
5. Leave it to cool


## Result

The pickle is great with lots of things and was a spicy sharp accompaniment to the chicken pizza chips.  It even made a great marinade for some beef because of the digestive properties of mango.
