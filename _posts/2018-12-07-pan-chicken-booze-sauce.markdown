There's nothing cleer here, in fact it's all a bit 70s French, but it is delicious.  If you want a cleaner finish, skip the onions.  For a richer one, finish with a drop of single cream.  I used a turkey breast because I love the lean, dense meat, but a chicken breast, a pork fillet or maybe even a piece of beef would work just as well.  For those who like mashed potato I'd guess this would go well  Add a leafy green veg (savoy cabbage this time of year) if you must be an adult.

Note: this is also a good way to ue up those ends of butter that you get whichhave gone a bit "fridgy" in smell

## You will need

* A chunk of meat.  See above. 
* A couple of small onions.  I used pink ones because they were on offer and are sweet.
* About 100ml of booze. I used the ends of 2 vermouths and a sherry. Wine would also work.
* A tablespoon of flour
* Butter
* A handful of herbs.  I used parsley
* A couple of teaspoons of capers (mine were in brine from a jar)


## Do

* Slice the onions and pile into your pan with about 50g of butter
* Slice on a very low heat, cover and leave for 20 minutes stiring occationally or until the onions are soft and translucent, with a touch of colour
* Meanwhile, flour your chunk of meat and beat a bit flatter if needed.  I shook mine in a bag with a good pinch of salt and black pepper.
* Once the onions are done, scape the pan into a bowl and leave to one side
* Add another 50g or so of butter the pan and raise to a low heat
* Add the meat, there should be a slight sizzle
* Slick your plates on to warm.  Don't serve this on a cold plate
* Cook though, turning as needed.  This took a good 15 mins for the thick turkey breast.  I cut it in two at one point to make sure it was well cooked through.
* Set the meat to one side.  It should have a reasonable crusty sear
* If needed, add a bit more butter to the pan.  You want a good tablespoon of liquid sloshing round
* Add the herbs, capers, onions and booze, then turn up the heat and scape scape scape all the stuck on bits
* Serve once the sauce has reduced a little


## Result

Deeply savour sauce, thick and juice chunk of meat, look at the shimmer on that sauce.
