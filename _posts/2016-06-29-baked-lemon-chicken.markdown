I love takeaway Chinese lemon chicken so much.  Even when it's bad, it's good.  I've already blogged a fakeaway version already using chicken being quickly deep fried, but this version is very easy on the weight watchers points, and that's pretty important to me right now.  The coating criss up inn the oven, not as much as deep frying but with enough batter to hold the sauce


## You will need

For the chicken 

* Chicken breasts (a couple per person)
* An egg
* Cornfour
* Garlic powder
* Onion powder
* Chilli powder
* Black pepper

For the sauce 

* Lazy garlic
* Lazy ginger
* Zest and juice of a lemon
* Cornflower
* Soy
* Drop of oil
* Honey


## Do

0. Stick the oven on at 180 oC
1. Chop chicken into chunks a little bigger than an inch
2. Beat the egg an mix with the chicken
3. In a plastic bag mix a teaspoon of cornflower, a good scrape of black pepper, a scant 1/8th of a teaspoon of garlic powder, a teaspoon of onion powder and as much chilli powder as you want (I went for about a quarter of a teaspoon)
4. Pour the egg off the chicken and stick it into the plastic bag.  Inflate it by blowing in, tie it tight and shake until everything is covered
5. Spread the chicken on a baking sheet and pop it in the oven.  I sprayed the sheet with some 0 calorie spray but I don't think it made much differece
6. The chicken will take about 15 minutes, try to have the sauce ready to go at the same time
7. Fry off half a teaspoon of garlic and ginger in a teaspoon of oil
8. Add the zest, juice and cornflower
9. Slake with a drop of hot water, the honey and a drop of soy, then stir frantically to blend the cornflower.  Turn the heat off once it's bubbling and the consistency of warm syrup
10. Once the chicen is cooked, mix with the sauce and serve immediately


## Result

I steamed some green beans, broccoli and baby corn, then mixed it all together.  Steamed rie would have been good too.  The chicken batter holds the sauce well and is sharp and sweet.  I could have done with baking the chicken a bit harder and maybe with a bit more chilli powder
