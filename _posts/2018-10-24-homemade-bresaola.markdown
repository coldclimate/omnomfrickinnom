I've been facinated with charcuterie for years (mostly because it's tasty) and I got given a copy of [Curing & Smoking: River Cottage Handbook No.13](https://amzn.to/2PSAdst) last year, so I bit the bullet and prepared to ruin a lot of very expensive ingrediants.  It was a bit of a scary journey, had a bit of a wobble in the middle, but came out ok.  As per always it was typically low tech and badly planned and thankfully came out ok.

## You will need

(You should probably follow a better guide or buy a book)

* A chunk of suitable beef, I used a chunk of [G&S Organics](http://www.thechristmasfarm.co.uk/) topside.
* Most of a bottle of red wine
* Peel of a lemon
* Peel of an orange
* A teaspoon of cloves
* 2 teaspoons of black papercorns
* A couple of fat cloves of garlic
* A big sprig of rosemary
* A good pitch of chilli flakes
* Butchers twine (I actually bought some in the name of hygine)
* Good quality salt

## Do (this takes 6 weeks or so)

* Wash, dry and trim the beef of any fat.  You can see in one photo I managed to miss a clump of fat in one bottom corner.
* Weight out the right amount of salt (check a book, I think I needed 80g for a 1.5kg chunk of beef)
* In a tubberware box with a tight fitting lid mix all the dry ingrediants
* Pop the beef in and shake it about so the beef is well covered
* Pop it in the fridge for a week, turning every day
* After a week the beef will had leached some liquid and smell amazing. No not panic
* You need to cover the beef in wine for a week.  To reduce the amount of wine needed I stuck everything in a ziplock and squeezed all the air out.  It still needed most of a bottle of decent red.
* Leave it for week.  Turn every couple of days
* Drain the beef.  It'll smell even more amazing.
* Tie the meat up with string.  Use a book. Find a diagram. I just did a loop round the middle.
* Hang it up somewhere drafty
* Go away with work for a month
* Come back and find it's gone very mouldy.
* Post photos to reddit and twitter
* Ignore all of their sensible advice
* Read the pages about mold in  [Curing & Smoking](https://amzn.to/2PSAdst) again and again.
* Decide you can always chuck it later
* Clean off the mold with red wine vinegar and a new toothbrush
* Hang it up for another week
* Check it smells ok.  Sweet, very slightly musty
* Trim the very tough outside
* Finely slice (I used a breadknife)
* Use the sniff test again.  Nothing sour, mouldy or dangerous smelling
* Try some.  It was delicious
* Put it all in an airtight zip lock bagP
* Wait 36 hours to convince yourself it's not bad.
* Marval at the result


## Result

Great taste, witht he spice and the wine coming though.  It was a bit over dried and tough.  I was worried the the outside had dried too quickly and the middle was going to have rotten (case hardening I think this is called), but I seemed to have dodged that bullet.

I'll certainly be doing it again, probably with a bigger chunk of meat and a bit more care.
