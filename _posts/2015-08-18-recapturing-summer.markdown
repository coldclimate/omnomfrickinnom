Today has been grey, cold, wet and exactly what the end of the summer shouldn't be.  Driving home tonight I decided to cook something full of summer colours and flavours.  Luckily there were some bright fresh tomatoes and discounted premade pastry for sale.

## You will need

* Shortcrust pastry.  It's easy to make but I cheated
* Enough tiny sweet tomatoes to fill the dish
* A handful of basil
* A mozzarella ball
* Salt and pepper
* a smear of garlic (I used the stuff in a tube)


## Do

1. Oven on at 180 oC
2. Line the tin with pastry (3mm thick roughly)
3. Chop basil fine and scatter evenly
4. Half the tomatoes and arrange
5. Smear a little garlic around
6. Scatter over torn mozzarella
7. Salt and papper
8. Bake for about 20 mins until golden


## Results

Sweet, light, rich but ready in minutes.  Served with a green salad with a sweet sharp dressing.

## Lessons learned

1. The tomatoes leaked a lot of liquid leaving a soggy sage, I should have grilled them hard with a little butter first
2. Too much cheese. I'm amazed I'm writing this.
3. Not enough basil (I'm not surprised by this)
