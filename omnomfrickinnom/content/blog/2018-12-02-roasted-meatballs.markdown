[Perfect Plates in 5 Ingredients by John Whaite](https://amzn.to/2zFuz6L) is a tremendous read and really quite an inspiring book.  This dish was very much inspired by it, with a bit more garlic.

This year we bought [a very expensive Le Creuset non-stick roasting tin](https://amzn.to/2zDS5Bc) and it's become my go to for everything that goes in the oven, mostly just to save on the washing up.  It has been *brilliant* and I'd buy it again tomorrow.

## You will need

* 500g of minced beef, not the super lean stuff
* 500g of ripe tomatoes
* A couple of chillies (I used the only one I managed to grow this year)
* A single clove of garlic
* A heaped teaspoon of black pepper corns
* A headed teaspoon of dried allspice (whole)
* A couple of teaspoons of olice oil
* A heafy sinch of flaky salt


## Do

* Stick the oven on at 180
* Half the tomatoes and arrange cut side down in a roasting tin along with the chilli and garlic
* Put the roasting tin in the oven
* Meantime, grind the spices and mixx with the beef and oil
* Mix and pound the meat in a mixing bowl until it's more "paste like", a little bit like Thai fishcake mix
* Divide into meatballs. I managed 8, but 12 or 16 might have been better
* Once the tomatoes and chilli are blackened tip the lot into a mixing bowl
* Add the meatballs to the roasting tin and put back in the oven
* Blitz the tomatoes with a stick blender (make sure the garlic is well blended)
* After a few minutes the meatballs will have started to colour, pour over the tomato sauce and dot with a few slivers of butter, return to the oven
* After about ten minutes, or when the meatballs are cooked through, serve with something to soak up juices

## Result

The meatballs should be juice and gently spiced, the tomato sauce should be firey hot.  The pounding of the meat leaves it with a springy texture
