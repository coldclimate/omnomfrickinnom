To try and break a bt of a food rut we've been in were trying out recipes from [Perfect Plates in 5 ingrediants](https://amzn.to/2KxnhJ6), shopping specifically for the ingrediants for chosen dishes, rather than doing a general shop and making stuff.

Tonight we swapped out the pousin for chicken thighs and drumsticks.

I'm not sure what the ethics around writing up the recipe so here's a list of ingrediants and if you want the method go and buy this excellent book.


## You will need

* Chicken pieces
* Honey
* Light soy
* A lime
* Blackpepper
* Ginger

## Result

Sticky, savour, sweat, gingery, super good.  Not a good match with the salad, some sticky rice would have been ideal.
