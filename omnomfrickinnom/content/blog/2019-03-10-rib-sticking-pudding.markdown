The weather turned cold and miserable today, so I decided to kill four birds with one stone:

1. Steamed suet pudding, to help get though the weather
2. Use up some oranges that were going past their best
3. Answer the question: can you make suet pudding in a slow cooker
4. Answer the question: can you use clingfilm instead of muslin and safe yourself a tonne of time.



## You will need

* 100g self raising flour
* 100g suet
* A pinch of salt
* Enough fruit to fill a 1 litre pudding bowl and something sweet (I used 3 oranges, 1 tin of pears and a heaped spoonful marmalade)
* A teaspoon or so of butter


## Do

* Prepare the fruit.  I went for chunks of orange about 2cm across
* Boil the kettle and stick the low cooker on
* Mix the flour, suet, salt and enough cold water to make a very slightly sticky dough
* Butter the inside of the pudding bowl
* Press the dough into the bowl reserving enough to make a lid
* Pile the fruit and marmalade in
* Lid with the remaining dough.  In my case it didn't quite fit but it worked out ok
* Clingfilm the pudding bowl 
* Stand the bowl in the slowcooker and pour the boiling water round it carefully
* Cook for at least a couple of hours
* Tinned custard is your friend


## Result

Savoury as all heck.
