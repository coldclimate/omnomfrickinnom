I love carrot soup, and it's super easy to make.  This was an experiment in cooking out the veg for an hour, almost roasting them, so that there were carmelised bits and a deep, rich flavour.  There's no stock in thi either, it didn't need it


## You will need

* A bag of carrots (enough to fill the bottom of the pan)
* A good blob of butter
* An orange

## Do

1. Top and tail the carrots
2. Pop them in a pan with a good knob of butter on a very low heat
3. Cook under a lid for an hour, shaking occationally
4. Add the zest of the orange, turn the heat up and sizzle for a few minutes
4. Add the juice of the orange, add enough boiled water to cover the carrots and boil hard for 5 mins
5. Blend

Th sharp eyed of you might notice the little bit of rosemary in the pan.  It and a bit of roasted garlic were left over from the roast the night before so I slung them in.  There was no need really.

## Result

Rich, thick, very fruity, needs a dose of salt and pepper
