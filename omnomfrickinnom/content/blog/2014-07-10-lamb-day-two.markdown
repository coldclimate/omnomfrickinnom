## You will need

### For the lamb
* A couple of ladles of yesterdays [lamb]({% post_url 2014-07-09-slow-lamb-north-african %})

### Crunchy salad

Use whatever you have around.  I was trying to get a balance of crunchy, sharp and sweet.  I used

* a large stick of celery
* a tomato
* a quarter of an onion
* an under ripe nectarine
* a handful of parsley
* juice of half a grapefruit
* a good pinch of rough salt

### To serve

* flatbreads of some kind
* butter
* a handful of cheese
* an avocado 

## Do

1. Mix all the salad ingredients
2. Put the lamb on to warm
3. Melt a knob of butter
4. Fry the flatbreads, flipping over once coloured
5. Quarter the flatbreads
6. Pile on lamb, cheese, salad and sliced avocado (I like the cheese on the hot lamb because it melts)
