I've been experimenting with marinading wings chicken in Irn Bru before frying them to see if the Bru flavours come though.  They do, but it's not as strong as I'd hoped.  After watching wings getting drizled with a spiced honey and lime mixture I wondered if I could get the delicious Bru goodness another way - a concentrated syrup.

Whilst I was on wasting perfectly good ingrediants I decided to make use of some dried habinaro chillies I've had lurking for a while, because fried chicken need that kick.  Just to double down on the Scottish theme, I added a couple of measures of cheap scotch.  This could probably have been skipped.

I've not not yet had a chance to make the next batch of wings, but when I do, a super thin drizzle of Irn Fyre is going over the top.  I've even bought a syringe to make application easier.


## You will need

* A litre of full sugar Irn Bru
* A cup of sugar
* A few chillis
* 50ml of cheap scotch.  Don't waste good stuff here.


## Do

1. Mix and boil down about 100ml


## Result

Amazing colour, serious heat, I'm figuring on 1ml per piece of chicken.
