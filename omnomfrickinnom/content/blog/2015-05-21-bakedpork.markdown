I doubt this is in any way authentic to any country, but get passed that and dig in.


## You will need

* A chunk of bely pork
* A handful of kale
* Sweet chili sauce
* Five spice
* Dark soy
* White wine vinegar
* Noodles
* Sesame

## Do

1. Score the fat right though
2. Rub the 5 spice into the meat side of pork
3. Mix sweet chili, soy and vinegar
4. Stick meat and mix into an air tight plastic bag and marinade for as long as you can
5. Pour off the marinade and reserve
6. Wrap the pork in tinfoil and bake at 150 for about an hour
7. Unwrap, place fat side up, pour over the marinade and shake on sesame seeds
8. Bake at 180 for about 20 minutes until the top is crispy.
9. Take out of the oven and tilt the tray so the fat drains to one end. Whilst it rests...
10. Boil noodles
11. Put kale into a massive pan with an inch of boiling water and a lid.  Steam for a minute
12. Drain noodles
13. Drain kale and splash with lemon, shake.
14. Slice the meat along the lines of the scores.


## Result

Crispy fat, unctious fat, spice, sweet, sharp and satisfying.
