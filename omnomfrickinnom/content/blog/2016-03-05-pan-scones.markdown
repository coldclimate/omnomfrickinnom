I've been craving scones and baked things.  Sadly they're not great for weightwatchers points.  Today I stumbled upon [cheese gridle scones](https://tamarindandthyme.wordpress.com/2016/03/03/cheese-girdle-scones/) on the excellent food blog [tamarindandthyme](https://tamarindandthyme.wordpress.com/2016/03/03/cheese-girdle-scones/).  I decided to have a go a making something which ticked all the boxes for me, but cost me less points, but removing the cheese and butter.


## You will need


* 120g of self raising flour
* Enough Fage Zero to make a loose dough (about a handful)
* A good pinch of dried mixed herbs
* A pinch of salt
* A couple of heaped teaspoons of nutritional yeast
* A good grind of black pepper
* A little butter to serve
* Flake salt to serve



## Do

0. Mix flour, salt, black pepper, herbs, nutritional yeast and Fage to a soft dough
1. Avoid handling too much but roll out to toughly 1cm thick then drop it into a non-stick pan
2. Cook on a low heat for a good 5+ minutes on both sides
3. Serve with a very thin slice of butter and a pinch of flaky salt

## Result

Mine were justa little too thick and needed cooking longer to cook all the way though, they were however, excellent with a cup of tea., a little like a potato scone.
