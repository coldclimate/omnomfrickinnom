Cooking pork twice, once to help break down the fat/cartalidge and once to crisp up the outside seems to be a winning formula and the combination of "poor man's sous vide" and the Airfryer works brilliantly.

Poor Man's Sous Vide: Pop everything in a bag suitable for cooking (I used a slow cooker liner), put that in the slow cooker and add a kettle full of hot water.  The water moderates and limits the total heat and the slow cooker gives a reasonable low temperature, if an uncontrolled one.  Clip the bag shut with a bag clipping thing.

## You will need

* A piece of belly pork (scored)
* A leek (fine sliced)
* Half an apple (sliced)
* A clove of garlic (sliced)
* Red wine vinegar (a couple of tablespoons)
* Something starchy to eat it with

## Do

1. Put the pork, garlic, apple and a third of the leek (a mix of the green and the white) along with the red wine vinegar into the bag
2. Just a kettle put of boiling water into the slow cooker and stick it on medium
3. Float the pork in and the water and pop the lid on
4. Leave it to cook for 5+ hours
5. Lift the pork out of the bag and set aide to cool so it holds it's shape
6. 20 minutes before you want to eat...
7. Brown the remaining leeks in a pan with a little butter
8. Set the airfryer to 200oC
9. Pop the pork in the airfryer for about 15 minutes until it's well crisped on the outside
10. Add all the juices from slow cooking bag to the leek pan and bubble away on the heat.
11. Slice the pork, serve with the leeky sauce.


## Result

The long cook renders the fat in the belly and gives that sticky unctious mouth feel.  The hot air crisps the outside wonderfully.  The sauce is rich from the retained pork fat but the sharpness of the apple and the vinegar cuts through.
