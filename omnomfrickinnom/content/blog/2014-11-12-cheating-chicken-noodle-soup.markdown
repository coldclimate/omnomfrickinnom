I love soups and broths.  I love chicken noodle soups, both of the rich and pleasing Jewish deli variety or the salted, spiced Asian sort.  As Week Of Illness continues, so it was deli style medicine tonight.  Super cheating, so much so your average granny would cry, but bag to bowl in less than ten minutes (yay for pre-roasted chickens)

## You will need

* A couple of handfuls of cooked chicken, chopped into inch sized chunks
* A tub of pre-made chicken stock, or good stock cubes or indeed (as I used) pre-made chicken gravy half and half with water
* A large carrot sliced thinly
* A small onion, roughly chopped
* A couple good pinch of dried herbs
* A few (5/6) pepper corns
* A glug of garlic oil
* A pack of dried noodles.
* A small bunch of fresh parsley


## Do

One pan, unlike last nights 4 pan extravaganza.

1. Put carrot and a touch of oil (not the garlic oil) into the pan.  Whack the heat up until they start to sizzle
2. Add the onion
3. Before the carrots start to catch and burn add the stock and peppercorns
4. Bring to a rolling boil for a few minutes then add the chicken.
5. Once the veg is tender and before the chicken is completely broken down add the noodles, garlic oil and parsley
6. Cook until noodles are done.


## Result

Rich, salty, garlicly and soul restoring.  Just don't confess to how it was made.
