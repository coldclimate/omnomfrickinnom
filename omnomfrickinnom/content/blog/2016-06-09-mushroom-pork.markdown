One day I'll cook mushrooms without cream, but that day is not today.  I boody ove mushrooms, and when you leave them chunky they're so good as part of a main course.


## You will need

* A pork chop
* Enough mixed mushrooms to cover a dinner plate to a depth of about 3 inches
* 3 cloves of garlic
* A big strip of thyme
* A heaped desert spoonful of Dijon mustard
* Salt and pepper
* Single cream


## Do

1. Peel and slice the mushrooms to different thicknesses.  Maybe leave some in big chunks
2. Pop the pork chop until a hot grill.  Turn it until cooked through. Remember the fat side
3. Meanwhile pop the peeled garlic (whole) in a frying pan with a spot of oil, pile all the mushroom on top, pop the thyme sprig on top, cover with a lid and put on a medium heat
4. Over the next 5 minutes the mushrooms will whilt, the garlic will soften.  Stir it all round.
5. Take the llid off, push th mushrooms to the edges and leave the garlic into the middle.  Bubble away until the liquid is nearly all gone.
6. If the pork chop is done you're nearly ready to bring it all together
7. Scrape the leaf off the thyme into the mix.  I just leave the twigs in
8. Squish the garlic, it should fall to bit.  Stir it all in
9. Turn the heat up and add a slug of cream, probably about 4 or 5 tablespoons
10. Add the mustard
11. Stir it all up and turn the heat up
12. Bubble away for a minute or so
13. Stick the pork chop in and cover it with the mushrooms
14. turn the heat off and cover with a for a few minutes.
15. Serve


## Result

Super rich, super tasty, needed some crusty bread to sop up the extra juice.  A squeeze of lemon would not have gone a miss to ake the edge off.
