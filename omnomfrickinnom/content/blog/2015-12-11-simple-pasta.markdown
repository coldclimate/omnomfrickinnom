Quick tea, very similar to the [mushrooms on toast](mushrooms) but with added seafood.  Lemon peel for flavour, lemon juice to cut the grease.

## You will need

* wholegrain pasta
* A handful of mushrooms
* A handful of cooked peeled prawns
* Zest of half a lemon
* Juice of a quarter of a lemon
* A big spoonful of soft cheese
* A few sprigs of thyme
* Black pepper


## Do

1. Slice the mushrooms and dump the thyme and lemon zest in a pan with a dash of oil on a medium heat
2. Put the pasta on to boil
3. Keep the mushrooms moving until they are nicely softened and slightly browned
4. Once the pasta is 2 minutes of being ready dump the prawns (defrosted) an cheese in with the mushrooms
5. Drain the pasta, reserve a few spoonfuls of the water to slacken the mushroom mix if needed
6. Mix lots, season, serve.

## Results

Creamy and luxary, not too greasy.
