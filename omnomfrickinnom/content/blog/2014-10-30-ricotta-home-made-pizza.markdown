After an amazing pizza at [Cal's Own](http://www.calsown.co.uk/) I decided it was time to have a go at making ricotta.

## You will need

* 2 pints of full fat milk
* A good splash of white wine vinegar or lemon juice
* 200g of strong bread flour
* a pinch of fast yeast
* pinch of salr
* a hand full of spinach (fresh or defrosed frozen squeezed dry)
* half a jar of premade pesto


## Do

1. Put the milk in a pan and bring almost to the boil
2. Add the lemon or vinegar, turn off the heat and stir a little
3. Leave for twenty minutes to stand.  The curds will separate from the whey.  It looks rank, don't worry!
4. Pour the whole lot through a fine sieve and reserve both
5. Put them in the fridge over night, the soft curds will firm up.
6. (the next day)
7. Mix flour, sat, yeast and 140ml of the whey.  Kneed to a firm dough.
8. Leave dough to prove for 15 minutes.  Why not turn the oven on to 200oC
9. Once the over is at full temp, roll out dough (I use a dusting of cornflour to make it easier)
10. Top with pest, torn up spinach, torn up ricotta and bake for 20 minutes.

## Result

The whey gives you crispy crust and the ricotta being smooth and delicious.  A splash of roasted garlic oil would go well too I imagine (I didn't have any in).
