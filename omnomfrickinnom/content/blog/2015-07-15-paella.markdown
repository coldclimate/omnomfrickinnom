I joked tonight that I should rename this blog to bastardisedrecipesforthelazyandtimeshortwhohatewashingup.com, and this post might be a perfect example.  Culturally bereft, easy and delicious

## You will need

* Half a medium onion, diced
* Half a yellow pepper, diced
* Half a mug of rice
* Half a stock cube
* Half a lemon
* 5 inches of chorizo, diced
* A bunch of parsley
* A heaped desert spoon of paprika (ideally smoked)
* A teaspoon of tomato puree
* A good slug of wine or less sherry
* A clove of garlic, finely sliced


## Do

1. Stick onion, pepper, chorizo, garlic and paprika into a pan with a lid, along with a teaspoon of oil
2. Cook with a lid on stirring frequently until onion as translucent and the fat is running (about ten mins on low)
3. Bung in the rice, stock cube, puree and wine.  Add enough water so that you've added twice the volume of the rice.
4. Bring to a very gentle boil, then turn down and pop the lid on
5. Cook until rice is tender and liquid is all gone.  Stirring frequently leads to a better texture
6. Serve with chopped parsley stirred through, a good scrape of black pepper and lemon wedges


## Results

Probably enough to make a Spanard cry (for the wrong reasons), but a very easy and delicious mid week tea
