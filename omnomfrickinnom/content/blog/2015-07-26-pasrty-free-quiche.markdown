Pastry is delicious but it is a faff.  Much like the [Teeny Tiny Cheaty Leeky Goats Cheese Tarts]({% post_url 2015-02-16-teeny-tiny-cheaty-eeky-tarts %}) these rely on a hot baking tray and the wonders of fat.


## You will need

* Fatty bacon.  Roughly half a rasher per quiche
* Leek (I used up some baby ones)
* Half an egg per quiche
* Milk
* A sliver of cheese per quiche
* Salt and pepper
* Any mixed herbs (I used parsley and thyme)

## Do

1. Fry the bacon slowly until crisp.  Reserve the fat
2. Pop a teaspoon of bacon fat into each muffin hole in the tray
3. Stick the tray in the oven at 180. It needs to be hot when you add things in
4. Slice and soften the leeks.  I use some of the green top
5. I whisked 3 eggs and 1 eggshell's worth of milk with salt and pepper, then dumped in fine chopped herbs
6. Dice the bacon
7. Pull the tray out of the oven and add bacon, leek and a sliver of string cheese to each.
8. Add egg mixture to each muffin hole 
9. Bake for about 15 minutes until risen and coloured.

## Results

Much lighter and a quiche, somewhere between a loaded omelet and a souffle.  The hot fat cooks the egg in contact with the side of the muffin tray quickly so they retain their shape.

I served with a dressed green salad.
