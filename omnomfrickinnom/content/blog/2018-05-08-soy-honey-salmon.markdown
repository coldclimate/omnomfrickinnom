I have a bit of a thing for sticky sweet meat dishes, and so this mid-week dinner was a bit of a guilty plesure.  The poached bak choi is a good foil to the rich fish.

## You will need

* A couple of salmon fillets per person
* A fat clove of grlic
* An inch or so of peeled ginger
* A couple of tablespoons of light soy
* A tablespoon of honey
* A tablespoon of citrus juice (I used a past-it's-best mandarine)

## Do

1. Finely slice the garlic and ginger (I used the mandolin)
2. Mix soy, honey, garlic and ginger well
3. Mix salmon and marinade and leave for a few hours, stiring every so often
4. Pop the grill on reasonably high
5. Boil the kettle
6. Pop the salmon into a pan you can put under the grill, skin side down and pop it under the grill
7. Separate all the bak choi leaves and stick them in a pan
8. Add an inch or so of hot water to the bak choi, stick it on a medium heat with a lid on
9. The salomn will take about ten minutes, baste as needed
10. Drain the bak choi, serve with a tiny drizzle of hoisin
11. One the salmon is carmelised on the top and cooked right though, serve

## Result

The fish is rich and sweet, coming away in big flakes.  The slices ginger and garlic hold their shape and the odd one is beutifully crisp.
