I was looking for a way to use up a ripe aubergine and some excellent pork mince when I ran across this rather excellent looking [roast aubergines with Szechuan fragrant pork](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/18/szechuan-aubergine-pork-recipe-courgette-feta-pie-thomasina-miers) made by  Thomasina Miers.

I didn't have quite all the ingrediants, but never let that stop you!

## You will need


* An aubergine
* 300g of pork mince
* A thumb of ginger (fine diced)
* A clove of garlic (fine sliced)
* A splash of hot sauce (I used the rather excellent [Holy Fuck](https://theribman.co.uk/collections/sauces))
* A teaspoon of Szechuan pepper
* A teaspoon of seaseme oil
* A teaspoon of [PB2](http://amzn.to/2rZbE0V) or peanut butter
* A shot of sherry
* A slug of cider vinegar
* A slug of dark soy

## Do

1. Pop the oven on about 180oC
2. Pop the pork mince of to brown in a hot pan
3. Grind the pepper and add
4. Half the aubergine and hollow out (a tablespoon works well), fine chop the flesh
5. Add the aubergine, ginger and garlic to the pan, stir and cover, cook for about 10 minutes
6. Rub the inside of the aubergine with the oil to stop it going brown
7. Add the PB2, hot sauce, soy, sherry and vinegar to the mince and stir
8. Cook for a few minutes
9. Pack the mince into the aubergines with the mine and pop them in the oven (I had to prop the shallow end up to keep it level)
10. Bake for ten minutes until golden

## Result

Difficult to eat (the mince separates from the aubergine), but tasty.  The spice comes through well, the cider helps cut through the pork fat, the sweet sherry balances the numbing of the pepper.

The bright yellow with it is fine sliced cabbage cooked with fresh tumric and topped with ground pork scratchings
