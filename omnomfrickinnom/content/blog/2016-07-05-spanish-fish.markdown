A little while ago the [Two Hungry Boys](http://twohungryboys.uk/) mentioned [Perfect Plates in 5 Ingredients by John Whaite](http://amzn.to/29jujvw) and I impulse bought a copy.  It's excellent, and a lovely read.  This is loosely based on a recipe in it I stumbled on last Sunday morning, but I think beneftted with the extra bite of the harissa paste (I'd opened up one of those small tins and now need to use it up)

## You will need

* Half a large leek
* 50g or so of chorizo
* A blob of butter
* A heaped teaspoon of harissa paste
* Half a chicken stock pot or a pint of chicken stock
* A couple of chunky white fish fillets. I ued some river cobler because it's more sustainable
* A handful of green olives



## Do

1. Slice the leek into a variety of widths, but a few millimeters to a centimeter
2. Soften in a deep pan with the butter
3. Add chopped chorizo
4. Cook under a lid until the oil runs and the chorizo has taken on some colour
5. Add harissa and sizzle for a moment
6. Add stock (or stock pot and boiling water)
7. Simmer for 10 minutes under a lid.  At this point I left it until the next day because I was cooking in batches
8. Add the olives and the fish 
9. Coook for a few minutes until the fish is cooked though
10. I served it with a big chunky bread roll


## Result

Spicy, salty, savoury, morish.  I couldn't help thinking a shot of sherry added at the last minute would have been good.

Limited photos, too busy eating.
