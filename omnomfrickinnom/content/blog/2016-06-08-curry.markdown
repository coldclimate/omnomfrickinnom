Sometimes you make something and it's OK, but it's not grea, and sometimes you can turn one dish into another.  Luckily this was one of those meals.  It started as a beef ragu made in a arge batch because this was going to be a busy week and being able to reheat a portion and pop it on pasta s very handy.  Monday night's dinner was a bit bland, so tonight I turned the remaining portion into a simple beef curry and it was tremendous.

I've written it up as if I did it in one go, but the truth is kinda important, sometimes cooking goes wrong, but it doesn't matter.


## You will need

* 300g of minces beef
* 300g of diced beef steak
* a couple of onions
* a couple of sweet red peppers
* a jar of pasata
* premade stock pot

and then to turn this into curry I needed

* Another onion
* a few cloves or garlic
* a few inches of ginger
* a couple of heaped tablespoons of curry powder
* a bunch of coriander
* a bunch of green beans finely sliced

## Do

1. Brown the diced beef in a heavy pan with a splash of sunflower oil
2. Add the onions, slices
3. Soften the onions, about ten minutes
4. Add the mince and peppers, stir and brown
5. Add the stock pot and the pasata.
6. Bubble away for 30 mins under a lid

Leave it until the next day, eat half, be a little dissapointed and then...

1. Brown a sliced onion
2. Add 4 cloves of finely sliced garlic and the ginger (grated)
3. Give it all about ten minutes
4. Add curry powder and sizzle for a minute
5. Add the left over ragu
6. Turn the heat down and bubble away for 20 minutes under a lid
7. Finely slice the beans and the coriander
8. When you're two minutes away from serving, stir the beans and ccoriander in
9. Serve with more coriander on the top.



## Result

So much better the second time
