A super quick tea, ten minutes from coming in the door to getting in your face.  This is also a super quick write up too, sorry.

## You will need

* A bag of mixed leaves, I picked up a spicy bitter one
* A pack of halloumi, cut into rough cubes (a bit more than a centimetre)
* The seeds of a pomegranate (I cheated and used those that come in a tub)
* A tablespoon of tahini
* The zest and juice of a lemon
* Pita breads or some sort seeded flatbreads
* Pomegranate syrup for drizzling


## Do

Once this gets started it's all hands on deck

* Pop the cheese in a hot frying pan with a teaspoon of oil, keep them turning until they are browned on all sides
* Pop the flatbreads in the toaster
* Whisk the lemon juice, zest and tahini into a smooth paste in a bowl big enough to hold all the ingrediants
* Once the cheese is browned dump everything excet the breads into the bowl and stir vigerously until everytihing is coats
* Pile it all into or on the breads
* Drizzle the syrup over the top

## Result

Sweat, sour, salty, crunchy, deep and rich.  It's not the prettiest dish because the tahini and lemon is a bit grey  A big handful of toasted nuts and seeds wouldn't go a miss.
