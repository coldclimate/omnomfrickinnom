This idea was everywhere a few years ago, especially on the American food blogs. I didn't ever get round to having a go (as a packed lunch) but given how much noodly soups feature in our house, it was only a matter of time.  Luckily at work there are hot water dispensers everywhere so come lunchtime I just added hot water and everything was go. 

## You will need

* A suitable piece of Tupperware.  I bought a [Sistema Microwave Soup Mug ](http://amzn.to/1g7Pr9Q)
* A block of noodles.  I used my favorites from the Chinese super market which are often used for chow mein
* Half a red pepper (sliced)
* A chunky spring onion (finely slices)
* A chilli (sliced length wise)
* A stock pot.  Next time I'll use half one
* Noodle soup condiments, I used soy, dried chillies in oil and hoisin.

## Do

1. Stick it all in your tub the night before
2. Add boiling water


## Results

Mine was a bit salty and had leaked in my laptop bag, so not as good as I was hoping, plus the hot water at work was not boiling.  All these are easily remedied next time. So much better than a dull sandwich.

If I'd had any left over cold pork or beef that would have been a good edition.
