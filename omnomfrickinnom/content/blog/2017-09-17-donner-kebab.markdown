Growing up I held donner kebab is the lowest of regards, writing it off as the worst quality meat and something I'd never eat.  Indeed right though university I managed to avoid it, right up until a couple of years ago when I had a bite or two on top of a pizza (there's another story) in Middlebough.  It was delicious.  Because of it's very disctinctive smell it's banned in our house, so a forbidden treat to be eaten on the back door step, more likely after a stressful week than five pints.

Anyway, a few years ago I ran across this article about [making a kebab at home](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2012/feb/08/the-diy-doner-kebab) and later this one [with pictures](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/gallery/2012/feb/08/how-to-make-a-doner-kebab).  I bookmarked them and never reembered to come back until Lee at G&S Organics got in touch aout our next meatbox and asked if I wanted anything specific and it sprange to mind.  Thus our next box contained a couple of pounds of finely minced lamb breast.

I normally get a potion with a large chips and then add some great hot sauce rather than the usual pita and terrible chilli sauce.

## You will need

### For the kebab

* A kilo of fine minced lamb breast
* A heaped teaspoon of black pepper (ground)
* A heaped teaspoon of cumin seeds (ground)
* Half an onion (grated)
* A couple of cloves of garlic (fine grated)
* A large tin (I used one of mango pulp)

### For the chilli sauce 

* A couple of peppers (halved and deseeded)
* A chilli (halved and deseeded)
* A clove of garlic (peeled)
* Salt


## Do

1. Empty your tin and wash it clean.  I froze the pulp for another day
2. Mix the lamb well with all the other ingrediants and kneed until smooth
3. Pack it all into the tin
4. Stand tin in a baking tray with a couple of inches of hot water
5. Bake for about an hour.  You want the middle to be well over 75oC
6. Take it out and pour off the fat (there will be plenty, I put it in a jar for easy disposal)
7. Leave to cool in the tin to firm up
8. Meantime, put all the chilli sauce ingrediants on a tray under the grill until blistered
9. Blitz in a food processor with a pinch of salt, sugar and the vinegar
10. Reduce in a pann if needed.
11. Holding the meat with a fork, blowtorch the outsiide until coloured then slice off
12. Repeat until you've enough to fill the pitas
13. Stuff it all in to a pita with chilli sauce and salad


## Result

I piled it into some hot pitas with some quark and green-herb-sauce (parsley, corriandor, vinegar, oil, garlic).  I should have had it with a handful crispy white cabbage but I forgot buy any.

Tastes like chipshop donner, but wih a crumblier texture.
