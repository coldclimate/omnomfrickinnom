I follow and love several American food blogs, but one of the things that gets right under my skin is the trite banging together of cultures in one dish. "Mexican lasagne", "burrito with Thai lime butter" and a million others, they just, to use a lovely geordie phrase, boil my piss.

Anyway, why do I mention this?  Because I almost called this dish Haggis Pilaf but really its not a pilaf, it's just stuff and rice.

## You will need


* Haggis out of the skin
* A handful of brown rice
* A good handful of green veg (I used greenbeans and sugar snap peas)
* A lemon (for the peel)
* A chilli
* A good pinch of [garam masala](http://amzn.to/1QCC6Eo)


## Do

1. Put the brown rice on to cook.  The rest of the dish takes about 10 mins to cook so time it so your rice is ready at the same time.
2. Break up the haggis and pop into a dry frying pan on a medium heat.
3. Cook the haggis through until everything starts to go a bit melty
4. Add the green stuff, chopped up into teaspoon sized pieces, the chilli (sliced fine) and the garam masala
5. Turn down the heat and cover with a lid
6. Cook and stir for another five minutes
7. Once the veg is tender stir in the rice (well drained),turn the heat up, remove the lid and let everything sizzle for a few minutes
8. Add a few good scrapes of lemon peel and a healthy squeeze of lemon juice

## Result

I topped mine with a spoonful of chilli flakes for some added bite
