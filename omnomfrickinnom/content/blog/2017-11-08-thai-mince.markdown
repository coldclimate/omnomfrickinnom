There's something very satifying about eating spicy food scooped up in a leaf.  This is 10 mins from start to face.

## You will need

* Pork mince (about 300g in my case)
* 2 small hot chillis (I used birds eye)
* 1 lime
* 1 stem of lemon grass, finely chopped (I cheated and used the pre-packaged puree - abot a teaspoon)
* 1 fat inch of ginger
* 2 cloves of garlic, finely chopped (I cheated again! A teaspoon from of puree again)
* A heaped teaspoon of dark sugar
* A good shake of fish sauce
* A good shake of soy
* A heaped teaspoon of peanut butter
* A lettuce you can scoop stuff up with (we had Romaine)
* A couple of spring onions (finely sliced)

## Do

1. Drop the pork into a hot wok with a splash of oil, start it off cooking
2. Fine chop the chilli, grate the ginger and put the kettle on
3. Keep stirring the mince so it doesn't get stuck in a lump or catch
4. Add the chilli, ginger, garlic and lemon grass to the pan and stir for a minute
5. Add fish sauce and soy (about a tablespoon of both), stir for a minute
6. Add the brown sugar and a small cup of water
7. Stir and turn the heat up.  Bubble until nearly dry
8. Add the juice of half the lime, turn off the heat, sprinkle the onions over the top and let it start which you make the peanut sauce
9. Mix a tiny splash of fish sauce, the rest of the lime juice, the peanut butter and a tablespoon of hot water until smooth
10. Serve

## Result

The mince mix is just slightly too hot, but the peanut mix taes the edge off.  Crunchy lettuce is fun to eat.
