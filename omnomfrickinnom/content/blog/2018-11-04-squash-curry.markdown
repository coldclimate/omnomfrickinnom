It's the time of year (the week really) when squashes and pumpkins are super discounted.  I've generally no idea what to do with them, but I pinched the method that HelloFresh often uses, roasting in the oven and then saucing.  This was mostly having a use up of other veg that had seen better days.

The raita here is chunky, with the yoghurt barely coating the cucumber, which should be diced to 2mm or so.

## You will need

* A squash.  Mine was about the size of a cantelope melon.  Peeled, centre scooped out, chopped into 2 cm cubes
* A couple of small onions (peeled and quartered)
* 6 cloves of garlic (peeled)
* A few mint leaves (finely chopped)
* A couple of inches of cucumber (fine diced)
* A couple of tablespoons of plain yoghurt
* A slug of olive oil
* A heaped teaspoon of curry paste (I used Pataks Madras)
* A heaped teaspoon of whole spice mix (I used [Bengali 5 Spice](https://spicemountain.co.uk/shop/spice-blends/bengali-5-spice/))
* 3 large tomatoes (chopped)
* A small knob of butter (about a teaspoon full)


## Do

* Stick the oven on 180
* Toss the squash, onions and garlic in the oil
* Sprinkle with a good pinch of salt
* Pop in the oven for 30 mins until everything is nicely browned
* Toast the whole spices in a teaspoon of oil until they pop
* Add the paste and sizzle for a minute
* Add the garlic (roasted and softened) and tomatoes
* Keep it all moving, squashing everything down with a wooden spoon, you're aiming to liberate all the liquid and start to create a velvet finish
* Add the butter and stir briskly to give a smooth finish
* Add all the roast veg and stir
* Stir the mint, yogurt and cucumber together.
* Serve with breads


## Result

Gently spiced, the sweet squash flavour comes though, the caremalised onions are great mouthfuls, the riata comes in big cool blobs.  Even the small amount of butter makes for a smooth and rich feeling sause.

Tastes much more delicious that the photo makes it look.
