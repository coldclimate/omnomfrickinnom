On this, the Summer Solstice, it shouldd not be a day for rice pudding, especially hot rice pudding.  But it's grey and Tupperware day, so here it is, my ultimate comfort food


## You will need

* 50g pudding rice (actually just about any rice will do, amazingly)
* 25g sugar
* about a pint of milk
* a knob of butter
* 8 green Cardamom pods
* a shake of ground cinnamon
* a strip of lemon peel (as long and wide as you like)

## Do

1. Mix in a oven proof dish
2. Bake with a lid on for about 2 hours at about 180 degrees
3. Take the lid off for about 15 mins so a skin forms
4. Eat with a teaspoon (trust me)


## Result

Sightly too wet, sightly under sweet, gently spiced, moreish.  Great hot and cold
