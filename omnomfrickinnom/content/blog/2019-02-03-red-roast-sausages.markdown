This was inspired by a Nigel Slater recipe that involved a lot of standing at the stove and stirring.  Being a lazy and busy man, I shoved it all in the oven and relied on a bit of vigerous stirring at the end.  Once again, a really good non-stick roasting tin is the way forward here.

## You will need

* Enough carrots, skins in, cut into inch sized chunks to cover half the roasting tin
* Enough beetroot, scrubbed but skins in, cut into inch sized chunks to cover the other half
* Four cloves of garlic, peeled
* A tablespoon of olive oil
* Enough quality sausage to cover half the tray
* Three glugs of pomegranate molasses
* Three glugs of red wine vinegar
* Salt and pepper


## Do

* Toss the beetroot, carrot and garlic in the oil in the roasting tin
* Give it a good shake of rock salt
* Lay the sausage on the top
* Put it in the over for 30 minutes
* Add the pomegranate molasses and vinegar, give it all the vigerous shake and stir (aim to rough up the edges of the vegetables)
* Return to the oven for another 20 minutes of so
* Once you're ready to serve snip though the sausages into bite sized chunks and  scrape up all the good sticky bits
* Serve with some crusty bread and a good dose of black pepper and maybe some more rock salt

## Result

Savoury as all heck.
