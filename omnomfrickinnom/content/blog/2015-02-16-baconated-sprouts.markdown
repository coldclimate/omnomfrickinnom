I've never really enjoyed sprouts but one of my friends pointed out that you could treat them like tiny cabbages and in the same week I saw another friend referring to "baconating the sprouts".  I couldn't resist.


## You will need

* Sprouts I used about 20
* 3 inches of left over leek
* 2 rashers of fatty bacon
* butter

## Do

1. Slice the bacon finely
2. Fry slowly with a little butter until crisp, lift out to one side, retain the fat
3. Slice leeks very finely and half/quarter the sprouts
4. Add back to the bacon fat, cover with a lid and sweat for five minutes or so
5. Add back the bacon, stir it all round and serve.

## Result

The leek should be translusent, the sprouts cooked but still firm, the bacon crunchy and bacons. Serve with a side order of roast dinner.
