Turkey curry is the scourge of this country.  I love turkey, I love leftovers and it breaks my heart hearing people whine on about "never ending turkey".  The good news is that everything on the Christmas table is even better (IMHO) reheated.  Forgot cold sliced turkey and bedraggled veg, time to break out the burritos.


## You will need

* A couple of handfuls of left over turkey meat, white and brown, chopped down to inch sized chunks.
* Half a large onion
* A tin of cooked black beans
* A bell pepper (red or yellow for sweetness)
* Any scraping of the turkey pan, or gravy, the stuck on tasty bits
* Any left over veg
* Left over cranberry, breadsauce etc.
* Tortilla
* A good pinch of Mexican spice (ground cumin, chili, black pepper, garlic powder)
* Half a lime



## Do

1. Slice the onion and fry until softened and olden
2. Add in the peppers (chopped and sliced) and continue frying for a couple of minutes
3. Add the turkey, beans, gravy (or scrapings) and spices
4. Turn the heat up and give everything a good stir.  You want it to be bubbling and melding. Everything is already cooked so don't panic if you think you've not cooked for long enough.
5. Throw in the chunkier left over veg (sprouts, carrots etc) and put the tortilla on to warm (I to this by stacking them in the colander and standing this over the steaming pan)
6. Take the pan off the eat once you reach a point where there's a good mix of textures.  The peppers should still be chunky and crisp, the beans will have softened with the heat and the turkey will be properly heated though.
7. Time to built burritos!  Smear leftover cranberry and breadsauce, add a blob of the cooked mixture, Squeeze over a little lime and maybe some black pepper, fold up and serve.

## Result

A little too sloppy, very savory, unctuous and satisfying.  Add cheese if you wish but I don't think it needs it.  A splash of hot sauce doesn't go a miss.

Sorry, no photos, I ate them all quickly.
