Nothing complicated here, just some lamb chops grilled fast are hard, grazed and served with a flavoured couscous.  I thought I had a pot of ras el hanout around somewhere but when I couldn't find it I improvised and loved the result

## You will need

* Labs chops.  I used us a bag of six from the freezer
* Half a teaspoon each mixed spice, cinnamon, sweet smoked paprika and sumac.
* A couple of teaspoons of a red berry jam.  I used up some cranberry and port jelly
* Couscous
* A handful of finely snipped mixed fresh herbs, I used mint and parsley
* Zest of a lemon
* A handful of pomegranate seeds.  I used frozen which are surprisingly good


## Do

1. Pop the grill on high
2. Pop the lamb under the grill
3. Mix the couscous and lemon peel and cover with enough hot water, leave covered
4. Mix the spices and jelly
5. Once the lamb is blackened on side turn them over
6. After a few minutes smear the meat with the spice goo and return to the grill but turn it down
7. 2 minutes before you're ready to serve stir the pomegranate seeds and herbs, cover again.
8. Once the gazing is bubbling and the edges of the lamb are blackened, plate up.


## Result

Sweet glze, sweet meat, crisped edges all good
