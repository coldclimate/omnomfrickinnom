Getting a regular meatbox from the awesome G&S Organics means that we've had a glut of roasting joint in the freezer of late, and much ad I love a roast with all the trimmings, they're not the most convenient of foods.  I also love things served in or on breads for both ease and taste.

After seeing several delicious things like http://www.closetcooking.com/2013/10/pork-tinga-tacos.html and http://www.closetcooking.com/2013/05/carnitas-tacos.html and Closet Cooking (a most excellent read) I started thinking about slow cooking a chunky of lamb in something reasonable plain but Moroccany and piling it up on flatbreads.  Because of the amount of lamb I ended up cooking this also made th next nights meal (post to follow).

## You will need

### For the lamb
* A chunk of lamb.  I used a 1.5 Kg piece of leg with the bone in
* A 200g container of pasata or a tin of chopped tomatos
* A heaped spoonful of ras el hanout (http://www.amazon.co.uk/s/?_encoding=UTF8&camp=3194&creative=21334&linkCode=shr&tag=wwwcoldclimat-21&rl=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=ras%20el%20hanout)
* A squirt of your favourite hot sauce.  I used Cambridge Chilli Sauce Co. Chocolate Habanero Voodoo Sauce (http://www.scorchio.co.uk/cambridge-chilli-farm-chocolate-habanero-voodoo-sauce-p-1656.html)

### Hummus

* tin of chickpeas (400g)
* heaped spoonful of tahini
* a spoonful of olive oil
* a squeeze of lemon
* a good pinch of good salt

### To serve

* flatbreads of some kind
* a pomegranate 


## Do

1. Mix all of the lamb ingredients and pop it in the slow cooker
2. Leave on low for 12 hours (or more)
3. Mash all the hummus ingredients together.  I reserve a handful to add back at the end to be chunky
4. Deseed the pomegranate (http://lifehacker.com/5895852/deseed-a-pomegranate-in-10-seconds-using-a-wooden-spoon)
5. Warm the flatbread
6. Pile hummus and lamb onto flatbread, add pomegranate
